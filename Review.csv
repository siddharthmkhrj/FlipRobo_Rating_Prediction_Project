0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
5,4,"For the peoples who R going to buy R they buyed this Product. U will Face all this Problems 1) Performance of the laptop is so slow 2) Booting time takes 40 sec coz of HDD 3)When u will play Heavy games like Gta 5 of pubg it will lag like A hell 4) Apps opening and closing time is soo slow and Feels like the laptop is lagging and performing Very slow. 5) Whenever u will game on It, The laptop will automatically Get lock and Restart.  Okay Now SolUTion For all of This -  1) Update ur Laptop to..."
6,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
7,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
8,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
9,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
10,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
11,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
12,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
13,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
14,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
15,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
16,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
17,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
18,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
19,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
20,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
21,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
22,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
23,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
24,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
25,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
26,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
33,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
34,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
35,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
36,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
37,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
38,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
41,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
42,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
43,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
44,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
45,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
46,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
47,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
48,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
49,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
50,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
51,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
52,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
53,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
54,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
55,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
56,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
57,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
58,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
66,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
67,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
68,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•.. Overall the laptop is beast because of Nividia GTX 1650 graphics üî•üî•..go for it don't hesitate to buy it's a beast for this price range and...
71,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
73,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
74,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
75,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
76,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
77,4,"Dont judge proformance if u dont know how to setup gaming laptop for gaming 1.update all driver and bios,without this u will face lag and start saying wrost product. 2.setup window mobility or power plan to high proformance and also set best proformance in battery,this will give u constant high proformance for gaming even in battery.but if you are not gaming than set in power sever in battery life otherwise battry drained in 1-2 hours and start crying. 3.Due to radeon vega 8 gpu 2 gb ram wil..."
78,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
79,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
80,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
81,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
82,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
83,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
84,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
85,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
86,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
87,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
88,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected.

89,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
90,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
91,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
92,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
93,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram
94,4,I using this laptop from three months. Autocad software are not running smooth. There are lagging problem for heavy autocad work so for autocad or 3 d software this laptop is avarage
95,3,"My initial product had to be replaced because of various issues, I believe I have recieved a product that was returned by someone else.  It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow. Second, updated windows and drivers.  Performance is ok and I'm not rating good because, the load time is very high but once wha..."
96,4,For Gaming Its Performance Is Fab .... But I don't Why it sometimes Lag In Carrying Out Normal Work (that can be due to HDD) Design Looks Unique ü•∞ Speakers are also Good & Overall A Very Good Choice For those... Who have Dreams of Playing Some High Level Games... In Low Budget Laptopsüòäüòä
97,5,If you are go for a decent laptop then I should recommended this as described there is a huge and most of the amount of power that can be delivered by a AMD ryzen 5 3500H processor can be processed and there is a huge lot of processing power and many more decent display decent power backup for 4.5 or and a decent multitasking and full HD display which can be a great pleasure for who can do Photoshop and title gamer why most of us for follow by HDD that can be slow your laptop so you can be go...
98,5,There is 1 slot available u can upgrade ur ram and boost your performance i buyed 8gb hyper ram and boom its amazing u can stay with its 8gab ram no prblm laptop is tooo good
99,5,"It needs upgrade as 2.1 gb of ram is reserved by the GPU itself, so your left with 6 gb of usable ram which bottlenecks gaming, so I upgraded with another 8gb of the same ram make for dual channeling and a samsung 1TB SSD, works smooth which few seconds of boot up and load up of games. Heating is slightly on a higher side, fan loudness is acceptable and battery is ; there's no way to say it but mediocre.  But overall with the updates I have no issues with this laptop, sound quality is good, d..."
100,4,"I am using this laptop for three months. It has only hdd storage, due to that the system was very slow. For boot time it takes almost 3min. Unable to do multitasking. All the operations like copy, paste,file unzipping takes more than 2hours. So within one week I have added sdd storage, since it has the compartment for sdd(cost:3k).Now it's super cool laptop at this price. I can able to do multitasking. I didn't faced any issue after that. If you are ready to spend extra 3k for this laptop you..."
101,5,"If possible buy the SSD version , or add an m.2 nvme ssd on your own (do this only if you know what you are doing). Without SSD its very slow, but yiu can still run a lot of things on it, just that yiu have to wait longer on loading screens. My boot time before ssd was around 1.5 to 2 mins, after I put Crucial P5 m.2 nvme ssd , now my boot time is 12 to 15 seconds. The display and keybord are perfect. Very sturdy design , its designed to last long. Camera is average, but I don't think you are..."

103,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
105,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
106,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
108,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
109,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
113,5,I just loved it ....It performed beyond my expectations...If you are planning to get a power laptop with sleek and classy design go for .... It will offer you great experience ...You will just love it..
114,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
115,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
116,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching
117,5,At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core
118,5,1)i liked it very much because of its design fabulus 2)dispaly was good and bright &veuvienig angles were also good at that price range 3)performace was excelent and it also come with 4gb nvidia gtx 1650 grafix card which can handle the heavy games &softwares easily 4)booting time is little bit late when compare with SSD laptop because it comes only with HDD the good thing is we can easily upgrade the storage with help of SSD up to 1TB 5)we can also upgrade RAM upto 16 gb and it comes with 8...
119,4,"The Product is Good Not Best. There are 2 Problems here, One with Ram and One with HDD. Well Ram issue is not the big issue Here, Games are still Playable. For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
120,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
121,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."
122,4,Ok So first don't trust on my english i hope you people can understand.  I review this laptop after 1 month of use i purchase this laptop on 3rd December 2020 today is 3rd jan 2021.   Look wise product is awesome. looks you want in gaming laptops this laptop satisfy the looks  Lets talk about display and the display is to awesome do not worry about display. Performance wise : you got amd ryzen 5 with radeon vega graphics(for display) and gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card with 8 gigs of ram but...
123,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
124,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
125,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
126,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected. All total you can go with this laptop but later you have to buy ssd and ram for ..."
127,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
128,4,"Honestly, this is a good laptop for multitasking and heavy gaming. But it also has some issues which is need to fixed. I highly suggest you to upgrade RAM (16GB) and SSD.  PROS: 1. Can play latest games like Red Dead Redemption at high graphics (30 fps) and GTA 5 which runs as smooth as butter at 60 fps at ultra settings. 2. Suitable for multitasking. 3. Gives high performance and a lag free smooth experience.  CONS: 1. Battery life is bad in this case..."

131,5,"After a month, I'm reviewing this Pros:- 1) The build up of this laptop is literally the best amongst other gaming laptop. Attractive. 2) Better crisp display & also you can do pretty good gaming on this laptop. Like GTA 5 on HDD with 40-50 fps n minor lags. 3) Better Battery backup. Lasts 3.30-4 hrs once charged fully. 4) HP support is appreciable i.e after service 5) Value for money n best at this price.  Cons:- 1) Hard disk rpm is less like 5000 ..."
132,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
133,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

140,5,Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.
141,4,Review after 2 months usage PERFORMANCE- It's bit slow because of 1TB hard disk..if it was with 512GB SSD then it was perfect beast..add SSD to laptop then it will be excellent..but no problem it's ok BATTERY-Battery is very impressive ...in battery factor it's the best laptop with more time of battery backup...battery best DESIGN-BEASTüíØ SPEAKER-best ever experienceüíØ PRICE- Value for moneyüíØ BEST IN ALL FIELDS JUST FOR SPEED ADD SSD

146,5,A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...

157,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
158,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
159,4,"I have reviewed this product after 7 days. First we should update latest version of nvidia gpu and amd Radeon versions and additionally windows updates also. I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings. If I played this game for long hour, laptop automatically locks and hibernate itlsef it is a major issue in this laptop. Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
160,5,Very nice product in this price range.
161,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
162,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
163,5,Beast with beauty
164,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
165,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
166,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
167,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
168,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
169,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
170,5,Just wow! üòç
171,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
172,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
173,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."
174,5,Let me tell a kutty story .. pay attention Listen to me...this laptop is just awesome naaüòÉ
175,2,Booting is very very slow
176,5,Nice product and nice luking
177,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
178,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
179,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
180,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
181,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
182,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
183,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
184,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
185,5,Asowm
186,5,Very good product and less price
187,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.
188,5,Best laptop at this prize range..
189,3,Good product but delay in delivery
190,4,Nice product..
191,4,Nice laptop.
192,5,Gaming experience is absolutely amazing...
193,1,i dont know why but my laptop is very slow i know there is no ssd but this us too much.. it takes time even to open My pc üò≠üò≠
194,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
195,5,It's awesome...
196,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.
197,5,"Beast üòç 100% I Recommend to buy .Graphics 1650gtx üî•Long Life Battery ...all in one kind this Laptop ..work, travel,gaming suitable ..No heat while play 6hrs Pubg ..you need to careful on edges ..bezel less dat's only problem"
198,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
199,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
200,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
201,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
202,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
203,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
204,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
205,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
206,5,Awesome laptop
207,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
208,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
209,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
210,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
211,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast

213,4,It's good.
214,5,Awesome in this price range
215,4,Good üëçüòé
216,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
217,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

264,4,It's look is awesome working good but a little slow as it is HDD. Will update about it performance later.  Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
265,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
266,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast

268,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
269,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
270,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
271,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
272,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
273,5,Awesome product
274,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
275,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
276,5,Better to put SSD in it
277,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
278,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
279,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
280,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
281,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
282,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
283,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on

290,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
291,4,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, for gaming this is the best....."
292,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
293,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
294,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
295,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
296,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
297,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
298,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
299,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
300,5,Nice to handle
301,1,"Absolutely terrible laptop, gta v lagging even on lowest settings.  Quite possibly the worst purchase and very much a scam. The laptop itself does not have enough RAM to even run MS Paint without lag. Do not buy it under any circumstances."
302,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
303,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
304,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
305,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
306,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
307,5,Great quality and good looking device.
308,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
309,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
310,5,Best in price but must add SSD
311,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
312,3,Awesome product.
313,5,Nice one but require ssd
314,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
315,3,Not bad
316,5,Perfect device in this price range
317,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
318,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
319,5,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
320,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
321,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
322,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
323,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
324,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast..i myself upgraded to ssd 500gb and 8 gb Ram and now the performance is best"
325,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
326,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
327,5,Goodüî•üî•
328,5,It's adorable
329,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
330,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good

333,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
334,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
335,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
336,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
337,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
338,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
339,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
340,1,Never buy from cheaters like flipkart
341,1,"It's too much slow my dual core laptop load faster then this, shutdown takes 1.30 minutes and apps lagged too much while opening worst experience till now please don't buy, and main point games are lagging while playing"
342,1,The worst purchase I ever made
343,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
344,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
345,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
346,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
347,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
348,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
349,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
350,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
351,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
352,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
353,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
354,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
355,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
356,5,Expect SSD all features are great
357,4,Nice product allover is good but ssd is important
358,1,Very very slow.worst product from hp.
359,1,This is very bad please don't buy it
360,4,Good performance.
361,1,Flipart People are frauds.
362,4,Super laptop at this price range...must buy no issues yet...
363,5,"This is a, budget gaming laptop"
364,5,Nice laptop
365,3,Best product
366,5,If you add SSD then it becomes beast
367,2,"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open."
368,1,Bad hp company Westez money
369,5,Excellent
370,1,Not the value of money
371,4,Nice
372,2,2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ
373,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
374,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
375,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
376,4,Except battery all features are good.
377,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
378,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
379,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
380,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
381,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
382,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
383,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
384,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
385,5,Very gud product
386,5,Nice but login slow
387,5,Good working
388,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
389,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
390,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
391,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
392,5,Best one
393,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
394,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
395,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
396,1,Worst product from HP don't buy this one very very slow
397,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
398,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
399,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
400,5,Best for 3D work
401,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
402,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
403,5,Overall good performance
404,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
405,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
406,2,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
407,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
408,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
409,5,Bad
410,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
411,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
412,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
413,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
414,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
415,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
416,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version
417,3,It is good but my delivery boy was very rude
418,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
419,1,"it working very slow , we have to add ssd to working properly, without ssd it is useless"
420,5,Best laptop for College students
421,4,Best laptop for students
422,4,Best laptop in th 50000
423,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
424,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
425,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
426,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
427,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
428,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
429,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
430,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
431,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
432,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
433,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good
434,5,Best laptop at this Price range
435,5,Best at this price
436,5,Simply superb !!
437,5,This is a worth product at this price..... Such a nice performance it has

439,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
440,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
441,5,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
442,5,Good
443,5,Just wow
444,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

485,1,"Delivery is much delay ... Buy only for coding and other responses , not for gaming.. I recommend to upgrade ssd for gaming.."
486,5,Added a SSD and now I can't expect a better computer at this price.  You can run it without a SSD as well. But adding one is highly recommended. You get a whole different experience. Totally happy.
487,4,Nice product
488,5,I am very glad to buy this laptop . It is my best laptop till now I buy all of them.
489,4,Nice laptop great......üëå

491,5,Worth for money
492,5,Value for money.and also good product
493,4,"The overall performance is so good,"
494,5,Very good laptop but little slow...design is just amazing..
495,2,Too slow nd charge drain out very soon not worth it!!
496,4,Better to use ssd for fast speed
497,5,Value For Money best laptop ü§©
498,3,Lil bit slow.. Rest everything all right. Moreover the product looks premium w.r.t price segment..
499,3,"I recently purchased this laptop and getting very good performance but having heating issue on right side of keyboard panel and left side of heating vents downside which is more than usual. This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore. It troubles you everytime you use your device. I've no option to return, only replacement is acceptable which worth nothing to me because I think the wh..."
500,5,"Genuine product, trust worthy."
501,4,Overall happy
502,5,Good product.....you can go for it
503,5,It is best laptop for gaming
504,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
505,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
506,3,Not for value for money
507,2,I think it is refreshing
508,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
509,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
510,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
511,4,U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.
512,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
513,5,Fantasticüòç
514,4,It's nice product
515,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.
516,4,Good but little bit slow if you used ssd than it will be okay
517,3,taking too much time to start
518,4,It is good product..

524,3,"After Using This Lappy , Geniune Review  It's working Slow due to Hdd Speed Is 5000Rpm  You Need to Upgrade RAM & NVME SSD"
525,5,Superb
526,5,Great product.
527,5,"Ok , nice Product under 50k range , but please increase your packing quality , this type of packing is not suitable for 50k item"
528,4,It is very good at performance and also best for gaming at this price If you want to buy dont think just go for it.
529,3,Performance not so good without ssd so i prefer to say must buy ssd for it.
530,5,Beauty and Beast üòç Will upgrade RAM Will install 512 GB SSD Worth every penny in this price range ‚úåüèª
531,4,"Slow like hell due to lack of SSD... otherwise it is best in this price range... go for it guys After adding a NVME M.2 SSD, I got better performance"
532,5,This is a good and best laptop
533,5,Nice product from hp. Value for money .
534,5,Best laptop under 60000
535,4,It's ok
536,4,"Build is perfect ,display is good ,battery performance is normal ,speed is value for money üí∞"
537,5,Good
538,5,Good for gaming and Web designing but it takes little more time to start and shutdown
539,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.
540,3,Poor quality of Flipkart packing
541,3,U need to upgrade it by adding more ram and adding and ssd without this lags a lot very slow pc
542,5,Everything is good..
543,5,Perfomace is good only bootup takes time due to hdd bit games run flawless
544,5,Good
545,5,Amazing product just lv it.....performance is awsome... What a display... Lovely....
546,4,good. but noticed lags in it .
547,4,you can purchase it without any hesitation
548,4,Use SSD for even more better performance
549,5,best gaming laptop
550,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
551,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
552,3,Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...
553,3,Battery life is too bad
554,5,Good laptop for this price
555,4,Speed is slow compare to others due to HSD however SSD can be further install.Display is very good and keyboard light is also attractive. Over all its good product in this price range.
556,5,Value for money
557,4,Laptop is good for mid graphl
558,3,This is a good product In terms of value for money. But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use. Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience
559,5,With 8gb ram its really hard to play games. Upgrade to 16 gb for best performance
560,5,Good laptop at all üòäü§üüí•üî•üíØ
561,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
562,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.
563,5,Looks so premium can't go wrong with this
564,3,"Purchased as per the spec but it takes too much time to boot, recommended to have SSD"

590,5,Wonderful product  It's awesome üëåüëåüëåüî•
591,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..
592,1,"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black Colour."
593,5,"Graphics ard is Nice Display is Nice Everythin is nice except 3 points 1. Startup problem (slow) 2. Batter life is too less (2/3 hrs during general use , not gaming) 3. Speaker volume is too low (almost half than other PC)  Every other crieteria is good Value for money Only Battery and Speaker disappointed me.. (Have to buy external speakers or Headphones)"
594,5,This is the best gaming laptop at this rate.. It's performance is very good display is also grate But the only problem is there is no ssd so booting time is slow
595,1,Got a cheap and used product usb ports doesn't work well if you try to transfer any file from mobile or pendrive it will show you 24 hours of time and Internet doesn't work either please don't purchase it from this seller
596,4,"Everything is good except the hdd feels slow,if you are buying this ,buy a 128 gb ssd minimum."
597,2,Everytime i am paying valorant after 3-4 minutes the screen is showing locking & shuts down... After 1 months of use the screen is getting backlight bleeding & dead pixels

609,5,excellent product
610,5,"The booting speed is very low i think add a ssd that problems will be solved. Battery backup is not much as i expected, and the usb ports are only 2 in this laptop that's the one problems i facing, but the laptop is very much better to compared some other products because in this price range gtx 1650 with 4gb graphics card is not available in any other laptops so if you want 60k budget laptop the buy this"
611,5,It's one of the best in the market I bought it and planning to save some money and then add a ram 8 gb stick and an SSD 256 gb and yeah it's awesome value for money.
612,2,"Not performing as expected , 40 - 60% ram utilisation was going for OS , There is minor lag in games too like asphalt 8"
613,4,"It's been two week since i have used it. For a price of 53k it a value deal.  Shadow of tomb raider: 30-40 fps (Medium settings) Witcher 3: Plays flawlessly in medium settings Total war 3k: 30-40fps (medium settings)  Just slap on an extra 8gigs ram and most games would run 30-40fps at medium settings.  Thermals: I played continously for 7-8hrs, it never throttled. Never expected this from a laptop at this price range, really outperforms. :)  Multitasking: Since the ram is limited to 6gb ca..."
614,5,"Everything is perfect but battery is good having average 4to 5hr. Due to absence of ssd it takes 40 sec to boot up ,it can be improved by inserting a ssd."
615,3,"It is a very good laptop. I am writing this review after one week of delivery. I used this laptop and found some cons. The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."
616,5,Nice product
617,5,"This is an awesome product, hughly recommended!!"
618,3,Good
619,4,Battery performance is good but Charing is too slow. All this are good. Design is very sleek. Color is nice
620,4,"Laptop is good but sound is not good and also reeboot time is too long to start the laptop, otherwise all good specially display is osm"
621,4,A ssd would be a better option. Battery is not as good as other laptop. Performance is not very great. Still.its fine.
622,4,"The product is very good and the performance is best in my opinion, battery life is also last longing according to my need."
623,5,Purchased for my younger son. He is absolutely happy. So I got the value of purchase.
624,5,Great Display and Sound quality .  Overpowered gaming but only problem is that the usable RAM is 5.92 GB.  You can add RAM and the AMD Ryzen 5 is a total beast .  Love the finishing and overall 4.5/5
625,5,Awesome ProductüíØ‚ù§Ô∏è Recommended for UI DESIGNERS!
626,5,This is nice product but I don't have my warranty card
627,5,Super ! Worth each penny
628,5,This is a good gaming laptop under this price range.
629,5,nice
630,5,Fantastic product with fantastic price point...
631,5,"Very nice,, ???"
632,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
633,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
634,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
635,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
636,5,Very slow processor
637,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
638,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring
639,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
640,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
641,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
642,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
643,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.  Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware."
644,1,Very slow laptop
645,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
646,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
647,2,"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi..."
648,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
649,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
650,4,"Battery drains very fast & this laptop is super slow. The main problem is in this laptop it's take so much time to start (one &half minute maximum) & it's folder opening speed also very slow,"
651,2,"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav..."
652,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
653,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
654,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
655,2,Very slow laptop
656,1,"I am using this laptop from 15 days plz don't buy this laptop it stop working, I am pissed of plz buy a laptop to your near storyüò¢"
657,1,"Worst product , Device not getting on after installation Just one day of use , laptop turned to be useless"
658,1,Very very slow üòí performance. Slow processor very disappoint
659,1,"Modern laptop need more fast processing ...but my laptop, haha even lots of upgrades I still found it's like 13 processor...it's very slow processing I am a bit unhappy ,it takes nearly 10 minutes to start,...which system now a days take 10 minutes to get in track ."
660,4,Everything is fine best performance but battery drains fast
661,1,Performance is slow
662,4,Best laptop
663,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
664,3,Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card
665,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
666,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
667,1,Always if you open any program it will show not responding not responding
668,3,"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system"
669,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
670,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
671,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."
672,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
673,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
674,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
675,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
676,1,Battery is week.
677,5,Its very slow boot up time is aprrox 2 minutes also i takes 20 30 seconds to open any application btw good for gaming but very slow
678,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
679,3,Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once
680,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
681,4,Good working
682,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
683,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
684,2,I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot
685,5,"Excellent laptop go for it Screen 5/5 Bettery 4:5/5 ,performance 5/5"
686,4,Avarage
687,4,Very good
688,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
689,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
690,5,Very good product..
691,5,Good
692,4,Battery is not God
693,3,Performance is slow
694,3,Best on this price range
695,4,If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.
696,5,Best for Multitasking and multiprocessing
697,5,Better than expected....üî•‚ù§ awesome product
698,4,"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment..."
699,4,Worth the money
700,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
701,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
702,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
703,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
704,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
705,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
706,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
707,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
708,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
709,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
710,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
711,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
712,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
713,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
714,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
715,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
716,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
717,1,I got a faulty product.
718,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
719,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
720,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
721,1,It heats so much.... unbearable...third class product of HP. Atleast low budget laptops have good performance but this laptop is so bad. It hangs like hell n then nothing happens. Very bad purchase. Nothing goes right with this laptop when compared to its specifications
722,1,I am using this laptop for about 4 months and it had ruined my experience it is worst thing i have purchased ever  it take about 1 minute to start or boot and still after that it get hanged up  i had run many softwares as an graphic designer and every time it screwed up at every last moment and  as for hp support they always tell to reset the pc on every call and every update never download properly  As for heating concern it heats alot if fans are not given it may explode Very cheap qual...
723,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
724,1,Laptop dead on arrival
725,1,Worst product Very slow
726,5,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
727,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
728,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
729,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
730,1,"I'm writing this after using it for 5 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable batter..."
731,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
732,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
733,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
734,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
735,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
736,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
737,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
738,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
739,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
740,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
741,1,This laptop is i am using but this is really working are slowly...i am not happy
742,1,Worst product..
743,1,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
744,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
745,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
746,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
747,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
748,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
749,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
750,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
751,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
752,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
753,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
754,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
755,5,Best in all way....
756,5,"Awesome budget gaming laptop, great performance and looks very cool."
757,1,After using a year I'm rating this laptop don't buy this product.this is the worst product.donot go on 5star rating.this product is worst
758,2,Very slow
759,1,UPON THE EXPIRY OF ONE YEAR DISPLAY STOPPED WORKING AND COMPANY CLAIMED THAT ITS NOT UNDER WARRENTY. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT BEING A GAMING LAPTOP ALL THE FEATURES MENTIONED ARE TO BE CAPABLE AND DURABLE KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT IS A GAMING LAPTOP. FOR NORMAL USAGE ALSO THE SCREEN STOPPED ALL OF THE SUDDEN AND COSTS ME EXTRA.
760,5,Good
761,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of continuous usage. Very good and nice laptop it has best in class display it also passes the the dead pixel test. Displacement astic performance I play a lot of games in this, CSGO and GTA V.  It can't run call of duty Modern warfare, as ram is only 8GB, out of that too 5.88GB is only usable.  Cons: Ram is low. Only 5.88GB I have the HDD variant, and there is no SSD. So my laptop hangs sometimes, and is slow. Go for the SSD variant  Pros: There is ..."
762,4,Nice product for this budget but get ssd model for faster response and better performance than the hdd one
763,4,Worth
764,1,Worst laptop don‚Äôt waste your money
765,1,Wrost laptop ever
766,3,"Good for gaming, but if you are a programeer as well then its worst. i m using this since a year but never feel its the worth of money ,3 times i done cloud recovery (master reset)  speed is not well even it had 8gb ram"
767,1,Very slow and worst. Pls don't buy this !! Complete waste of money
768,2,"Go for a bit better version of pavilion gaming laptop rather than this one. Only 2 months and I have already replaced a harddisk, frequent lags (too much lagging) and works a bit slow. After windows 11 update it's like potato. Had better expectations from hp. Seriously"
769,1,Very bad product  It‚Äôs super slow and takes 20 mins to start.  Never expected this from a brand like HP‚Ä¶
770,1,"Getting very slow after every 2 or 3 month. Don't purchase, if anyone going for this product"
771,3,"Currently you can find a better laptop at this rate, Avg product, High battery usage if you do some heavy work,  Strong and hard piece."
772,1,its too slow after 3 months of use
773,1,Waste of money...!! Never buy this seeing anyone's review...its bad and slow after 3 months u will regret buying this laptop
774,5,"Have been using this for few months now and am loving it. The experience, reliability, and the large screen makes it really cool!"
775,2,"Haven't download any software still hangs a lot after 7months of usage the disk, CPU and memory space always goes to 100"
776,2,Too much hang
777,4,It is very powerful but because off hdd it is litely slow but no problem it Play gta v very easily in any setting
778,4,"Good budget gamming laptop from hp,I am happy with this laptop,"
779,5,I am using this laptop for 1 year now best value for money
780,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
781,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant
782,5,So lets keep it simple fantastic product unless the vents at below it are open enough For gaming can handle everything And If u gaming try rising the laptop slightly to open up the vents which will make the performance noticeable way better multitasking will improve and the hdd kinda slow but when it also given enough breathing room will perform just well so prefer slightly rised like a cardboard roll shud do just fine Overall 10/10 its epic and the specs are just fine to stream and record...
783,5,"This is amazing I can use this laptop no lag,not any issues best laptop I think everyone buy this laptop"
784,5,"Great product , superb result , happy with the purchase ."
785,3,"This laptop has a Nvidia 1650 graphics card but by default internal onboard graphics is preferred by laptop for games. You need to change this setting in Nvidia control center to use Nvidia for graphics and games. Major downside of this laptop is it comes with 5400 rpm hard-disk, which causes it to perform very slow. For those who got this laptop with SSD, no problem for them, but for remaining they need to buy additional SSD to get decent day to day usage performance from this Laptop. Fina..."
786,5,All things are good and best But SSD is must Minimum 256gb Overall performance is very good....

790,1,Worst Laptop For gaming or daily use too. So much hanging issues and lagging issue and booting issue too.
791,1,"Always hanging, not always showing not responding"
792,5,hard disk is slow...you can install ssd must
793,1,Bit battery backup is low
794,5,"In short I would say, WORTHY!"
795,1,Worst model
796,2,Very slow
797,3,"Laptop is powerful and hardware is best,but the quality of hard disk is so bad,it crash in 1year after buying,i reccomend you to buy the its ssd version or you can upgrade to ssd after buying."
798,4,On this price....good performance ü•≥
799,3,Hdd are very sloww.
800,1,"Laptop is tooo slow on both off and on, lag while watching movies, lag on process, many apps and software are not responding"
801,1,"Very bad item, it's got stuck every time and responding time is tooo large it's totally waste of money pls üôècheck before you buy"
802,5,Value for money
803,5,Should update Ram and Ssd to avoid slow performance. Other than that every thing is good
804,2,"DONT BUY HDD.go for SSD. day 2 laptop got automatically shutdown and when it came up, there is no operating system. I had to buy it for my own money."
805,5,Good Performance Laptop

807,5,Satisfied.
808,4,"Good purchase from Flipkart, a bit slow even after with SSD so far good experience with the product"
809,5,It's very good.. Worth of money
810,2,"Slow start ,"
811,4,Worth the money
812,3,It was really nice I like it
813,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
814,3,It takes too much time to boot up.
815,3,Ok
816,2,Gaming performance was very good since it uses the graphics card. Rest of the normal day to day performance was very bad. The pc runs very slow and lagging even when you open a browser.
817,5,ITEM DELIVERED INTACT AND PERFORMING SATISFACTORILY TILL DATE. NO DEFECT FOUND AS I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 12 MONTHS.
818,5,Very good but take some time to booting
819,4,"Amazing laptop, but slower because of HDD, if my budget was more I would have bought same laptop with SSD."
820,4,I think because of HDD this product is getting too slow running
821,3,very very hang but looking is good
822,3,Should buy it.......!
823,4,Good product
824,5,Satisfied with this purchase.. Don't expect much from a ryzen 5 processor but powerful enough for programming and coding.

834,5,Amazing Laptop for mild gaming...If you are not a professional gamer and just wanna play for fun this lap. is highly recommended...Even good for coding!!...best at this range ...and it's design is just lit!!!..ü§üüî•
835,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
836,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
837,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.
838,4,Just upgrade with SSD then it's great
839,5,I am using this laptop from last 6 months and I must say it worths. If you are looking for gaming laptop then this laptop will the best option for you. You will neet to upgrade with SSD. You can use it for official work also
840,5,Good
841,5,I love it
842,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
843,4,It takes too much time to start
844,5,Good
845,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???

858,2,"Very slow performance, it can irritates. If you buy it be patient while working on itüòÅüòÅüòÅ and it's not an gaming laptop performer.."
859,1,Speed Not good.
860,4,It is a very good laptop. Very good in this price range. Don't have too much expectations as mentioned in some other reviews. Only problem is 5.9 gb ram ( 2.1 gb is reserved for integrated GPU.
861,3,average
862,4,You Must have to upgrade the laptop ram for playing high specs games like GTA V and others. BTW nyc design and performance..
863,4,GOOD FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING.. BUT RAM UPGRADE IS NECESSARY FOR REACHING ITS POTENTIAL... ALSO SSD UPGRADATION FOR FASTER BOOTING TIME AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT..... RYZEN 3550H ITSELF IS A GOOD BUDGET PROCESSOR FOR MEDIUM- HIGH GAMING BUT THE PROCESSOR ITSELF TAKE UP 2GB OF RAM AND THE INSTALLED APPS ALSO CONSUMES MORE THAN HALF OF THE RAM SPACE..WHICH LEFT THE USER ONLY 2-3GB OF SPACE... SO BETTER TO UPGRADE... ITS LACKS LIKE HELL IN JUST STOCK 8GB RAM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LAPTOP IS...
864,5,Really very good
865,4,Nice performance but sometimes get stuck when am working on my office domain.. I don't think it's good for gaming purpose... I am giving review after one year of use.. in between battery was draining very fastly.. but customer care helped and resolved quickly.. Tbh look is very cool but sharp edges are there.. packaging was very nice and safe also the delivery was on time... Thanks
866,1,I been using these product it's completely slow not worth of money you may regret after buying these product
867,1,"Slow working battery drain,"
868,5,Worth it
869,1,"Performance is pathetic while working with AI or photoshop. I think Flipkart is worst in handling fake product supplier, I think Flipkart actually receives handsome margin through supplier that‚Äôs why promoting it through its platform"
870,3,System is good but booting time it takes around 55 seconds and while updating windows system becomes very slow.
871,5,Requires SSD for better performance
872,5,it's so impressive and value for money... Overall it's showing great performance but u have to add ssd for better performance in gaming...
873,3,Poor performance
874,3,Frame drop happens when we play gta 5

876,5,"The laptop is good the build quality is awesome and display,battery etc are excellent but you will get disappointed of the performance it takes around 5 minutes to boot it up and it lags even while using chrome with multiple tabs. Hope it will be better in the ssd version of the same laptop"
877,5,nice
878,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."

892,2,Not what was expected
893,3,Performance is low
894,4,The hinges are looking cool and give this laptop a cool look but in day to day usage they create problem. Screen is shaky cz of these hinges . Also there is no ssd i highly recommend if u are going to buy this laptop purchase a ssd soon. Overall laptop h fine. Gaming performance is great .

897,5,Value for money product
898,1,Very slow performance.I am not happy with this product. So you don't buy it and go for other except HP.
899,3,Process is very slow
900,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."
901,1,Very bad

904,5,Best in this segment
905,5,"just upgrade it to 225 ssd, and then it will turn into beast.."
906,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...
907,2,Very slow processar. Even after 8gb memory system hangs !
908,2,This product having lagging problem
909,4,Premium looking laptop . ‚ù§Ô∏è Value for money .‚ù§Ô∏è Don't think about it just go for it‚ù§Ô∏è

911,5,Wonderfull
912,4,Good
913,1,The performance of a brand new unit was pathetic. The purple backlit sucks. The font on keyboard is not comfortable. Had to run a check with HP assistant. I dont recommend
914,2,Not suitable for gamers
915,5,With unique design and Backlit keyboard this looks fantastic..... But on the part of functioning it take a very long time to start... It seriously consumes much time to stable after restart too...
916,5,Awesome Gaming laptop

918,5,Super laptop at this price segment.
919,3,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
920,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
921,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...
922,5,Best laptop
923,4,"It's boot up slow, tools are 40 seconds due to HDD, otherwise it's OK."
924,5,"Don‚Äôt buy it if ur main aim is gaming.it has only 6gb usable ram and for gaming an additional 8gb ram is must.boot time is ok and can be made better with ann ssd.battery,sound and display r just wonderful.if ur going to college and want a gaming under budget I‚Äôd suggest u to go for it"
925,5,Great laptop for daily office use. On time delivery. Genuine product. Good packaging.
926,5,Worth of money
927,5,"Absolute beast keeping in mind the budget of the device.  I do not play games, rather I bought his for product and graphic design.  Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."
928,5,Design super Sound quality super Display normal Battery usage super Totally value for money this product

934,5,Thank you
935,4,Speed is slow but value of money for hp laptop and I suggest go with ssd varient
936,1,Speakers are not working !!
937,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.
938,5,good look and performence
939,3,No SSD - makes loading new software very slow. Else good product.
940,1,I review this product when not added extra ram or ssd the performance may vary on adding them.Pls don't buy this product if you want üôè good performance it is not worth this price.pls go for intel i5 for this price range. I can't even open the task manager quickly when nothing is opened.pls hear my review. I felt very much for purchased this product. Many reviews says that it is a performance beast but i dont think it is a performance beast. I didn't take care of those negative reviews now i...
941,1,"They say it have 8gb RAM but 2.1 gb is hardware reserved So actual usable ram is 5.9gb only. I have use it for 3 months, lags during playing game even when using gpu. Battery life is not up to the mark. Overall its not worth the price."
942,4,good
943,5,Good product
944,5,best laptop
945,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...
946,5,Best gaming laptop in this range..... As everyone said u need a ram and ssd for best performance

954,5,"Worth the money. SSD only gives 15-20 fps, without that itself its a beast, but some few lags in some point."
955,3,Nic laptop But it's booting time and performance is slow
956,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
957,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
958,5,Nice but not that much
959,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.

967,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
968,5,God
969,1,It was very slow by starting and slow performance. Simply don't waste u r money on this laptop.
970,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
971,5,excellent
972,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
973,5,This is a budget gaming beast
974,1,Worst Laptop I ever purchased Don't Buy It Pls Waste of money It hangs too much
975,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
976,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
977,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
978,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
979,5,Very good....
980,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
981,5,Best Product
982,1,It's the worst gaming laptop ever don't buy it.
983,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
984,1,This is the worst laptop that anyone can buy for gaming after a year the system is super slow... majority time there is a huge FPS drop while playing games.... it can not take heavy application during work time.... dont buy this Laptop u will be wasting ur money
985,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
986,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
987,1,Please don't buy???
988,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
989,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
990,4,Good
991,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
992,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
993,5,Great design with better performance
994,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
995,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
996,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
997,4,Aavarage system running slow
998,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
999,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
1000,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder
1001,5,Sorry to say this The flipkart coustomer care are not responding properly when it need Am facing the issu with charger It's sparking wile charging cable connected to laptop. Am raised a request several time to Share my issue They are rising a request for call Also schedule time but not a call or massage recived from connesernd.
1002,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
1003,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
1004,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
1005,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
1006,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
1007,2,"Not value for money it is better to order another product System takes to long to open main window,after installing only 1 game (valorant) it started lagging not expected thisüòûbetter order MSI with ssd do not go for hdd laptops if you want gaming laptop"
1008,5,good
1009,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."
1010,4,Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞
1011,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."

1013,5,"Very good laptop, but MS office is not pre-loaded"
1014,5,Nice one for all
1015,5,"Initially i was fed up with my selection, even after adding 8GB of RAM & 1TB SSD, But once i moved the OS to SSD this becomes beast, excellent performance and awesome speed, Still battery will be a problem, but you cannot expect more that this from this budget and configration,  Worth buying..!!!"
1016,4,Really great product üî•

1019,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube.

Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."

1026,5,"Best laptop for mechanical design softwares , go for it"
1027,2,The laptop is very slow. Not worthy
1028,4,"The product is good.. But as highlighted by many other reviewers, laptop is slow because of HDD. Add an additional ssd for operating system and the laptop will work fine."
1029,5,Phisically it looks much better than pic awesome mid weight laptop
1030,5,Nice laptop
1031,5,This laptop is best in this budget and also this lags a lot but we can fix it by upgrading SSD
1032,5,Super working
1033,4,"Overall a value for money product...does not gets heat,good design and build overall"
1034,3,Booting up and opening an app is very slow
1035,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
1036,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
1037,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming

1039,4,Its work very slow.

1041,5,Good but more laggy and display ausome everything ausome but it laggs more
1042,5,Product is very good. But when I opened for the first time it took almost a hour to open. But overall it's best value for money product.
1043,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
1044,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"
1045,4,"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os! But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!"

1058,4,"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available."

1102,5,Great laptop for price..but you have to upgrade ssd & ram.. after that it will become beast... battery not that great... charger heats up alot while playing games .. Overall great product...no ms office..
1103,4,SSD+RAM =Total Bease
1104,3,Fornsome reason the lap was lagging from day one... Had to put in an ssd to solve it and i experience zevere frame drop while playing rdr2 in lowest settings... Domt know y... If anyone knows lemme know
1105,5,"Bought this 4 months ago for module designing it performed nicely slower at the initial but now got updated and its lightning fast without ssd also speed is good, only upgrade needed is ram which is optional now.. its a value for money product playing heavy games and using designing software together it doesn't glitch, i was skeptical about it as first but now i feel it was a right decision. Happy to buy ?"
1106,4,BUILD quality is not so good. hp should think about this. otherwise inthis price this is very good spefication. good laptop. you can buy this.after buying if you add one ssd & 8gb ram then it's perfomance will go another level.
1107,1,Not worth it's price
1108,4,"Not bad , battery drains fast , slow processing not as good as expected buy ssd . ü•∂ü•∂"
1109,4,Best product in the range
1110,5,All Rounder
1111,3,First of all The delivery was late You need to buy a ram stick and a ssd other vise you have to wait a long time to start or reboot the laptop
1112,2,The performance is not great... don't go after this product because of the popularity...The gaming performance is very average... couldn't play watch dogs 2...it's lagging way too much even in lowest graphic settings... disappointed
1113,4,build quality - best plastic speaker - trust me not the loudest but best speaker in this price segment and also beat in terms of 60k laptop trust me you will love it  performance - due to hdd it will lag or slow at time of booting thats hearts üíî  display - no words ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è  and at last there will be frame drop due in gta v due to low ram because the usable ram is only 3 gb out 8 2 gb is used due to amd procceser and out of 6 gb usable is only 3  so if you are going to buy this laptop in 2...
1114,5,Buy without thinking. Excellent product at this price.
1115,4,Everything is good but One thing disappoint that ms office is not pre-installed.
1116,5,"It contains amd radeon 2gb+Nvidia GeForce GTX 16504gb graphics cards.But usable ram is only 5.95gb Disappointing thing is only the matt black colour ut contains alot of fingerprints and dust. Amazing,superb, greatest product.Thermals are extremely good.It contains alreday license of windows 10.Sound quality like a smartphone."
1117,5,Thank You Flip kart
1118,5,"A great laptop on this price range. After using it for 3 days im so happy that i choosed this laptop over acer aspire 7 and msi gf63 thin. Pros: -Great performance. An imperfect Gaming beast -Great thermals, can handle AAA titles within 78-80degrees then instantly cools down back to 44 when game is closed. Which is great for a budget gaming laptop. -less bloatware filled windows . -Great battery backup. Its new but i got a great battery backup of 5hours+ when using it to download my stuffs a..."
1119,2,"This is the worst product i ever used , performance wise it is very slow . If I compare its speed, it is the same as a mini notebook or the same as a normal laptop. If i talk about its speed it takes 30-40 sec to open an excel file. I am very disappointed with its performance . As a gaming laptop it has to respond on just a click.  I have not received any benefit with this product even Microsoft word, excel & power point are also paid software. I am suggesting never buy a laptop through onl..."
1120,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
1121,5,Amezing product
1122,5,Good
1123,5,Overall nice product But only thing is you need to upgrade Ram & SSD HDD is slow

1125,3,"After 5 days of usage. This one is pretty decent product, not installed any games. If anyone played games please let me know how is it's performance. However start-up seems slow is it only me or everyone's having same issue?  Overall i can give 3/5 rating for this"
1126,4,Excellent
1127,5,I buyed it for my Son and he loved it
1128,1,It's very slow when we edit videos
1129,1,"Don't buy this product, laptop is very slow as compre to other and it's keyboard and touchpad is also don't work properly other many software problem"
1130,5,Awesome Product Must Buyü§©
1131,3,System is not upto expectation.. very bad experience . Task manager is even not responding some time.. waste of money
1132,4,The laptop is great but the battery is very bad but since it's a gaming laptop battery isn't expected to be good.It is a bit slow though and crashes a lot
1133,4,"After using this laptop continues 8 months I think this best buy laptop in 50K Display is good Screen Flip mechanism is good after 8 months by by flapping thousands times hinges are good as new processer is fast with no lag while using laptop or playing game ,pc game I meant like PUBG-PC,COD,cricket19 etc  Yes it consume more battery when you play game or use high spec software.

1136,1,HDD is damn slow.. after a month the system is not booting up. Please don't purchase this laptop
1137,1,Poor quality camera... slow performance... Not at all value for money.. Requested for replacement... Lets see..
1138,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1139,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow
1140,4,Good prodect
1141,5,It is so nice.... I love this laptop.. It is running very smoothly... For programmers it is the best laptop.... It is also good for light gaming no lack issues show in this laptop.... Nice product... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1142,2,Laptop is very slow and it stucked
1143,2,Battery backup is low . Performance is poor.
1144,5,Throw in a nvme m.2 and you are good to go. Either purchase the modal with ssd or install one. Otherwise don't buy it.
1145,5,It's a cool laptop it is especially good for online classes and gaming üëå if you are a student or want to become a gaming YouTube then you should buy this it's pretty cool üòé
1146,1,Don't buy it for higher level works Not good product very slow

1154,5,Awesome Laptop ü§†üíª Value For Money ü§ëüí∞ Recommended for everyone üòÄ
1155,2,i am use 2 week but laptop is very slowly open not fast open time 18 second my second pc 6 second open
1156,4,"Decent product , good for gaming , don't even think for buying it for daily purposes"
1157,5,"Loved it, awesome product. üíñ"
1158,4,Very good laptop for desent gaming
1159,5,Nyc laptop It's working smoothly Design is also good
1160,5,My keyboard was faulty
1161,3,Heating and lag issue...
1162,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
1163,5,Nice good laptop
1164,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1165,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1166,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1167,5,It's the beast go for it
1168,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1169,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
1170,5,beast laptop at this price
1171,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1172,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1173,5,good
1174,5,Great after 1 week of use
1175,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
1176,5,Good products
1177,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1178,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1179,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1180,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1181,5,Very good product value for money
1182,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1183,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1184,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1185,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1186,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1187,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software
1188,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
1189,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1190,5,Good Product
1191,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1192,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1193,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1194,3,I can play free fire with lag
1195,5,Awesome product
1196,1,Waste of money
1197,4,"When I bought this loptop earlier I thought why it performs very slow like opening applications, loading, taking more time to boot up later, I realised and I added SSD to this after that it will performing like a beast and now it is booting in 15 seconds. I am playing forntine, Apex legends, Minecraft, valorant etc., I didn't get any issues like lagging while playing the games even in 8 gb ram. In future I will upgrade ram to 16 gb but now this was enough to me. Coming to laptop Display quali..."
1198,3,Decent product

1201,3,U can fell the lag and don't even dare to install BlueStacks.It'll hang
1202,4,Everything is perfect according to the price but it definitely needs a ssd upgrade Rest all is excellent
1203,4,Beast
1204,5,All rights but boot is very slow
1205,5,It was really a nice product
1206,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not
1207,1,Booting time is to long very slow performance and not worth it
1208,3,Not satisfied with the performance speed...
1209,5,Very nice product . Delivery before time . Satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
1210,4,Entry level laptop
1211,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1212,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1213,5,Good performance...
1214,5,It is best under prize range
1215,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1216,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."
1217,1,Charging port loose connection & very slow performance Not satisfied.
1218,5,Super laptop bro ...

1222,3,Product ok but we need to upgrade to ssd
1223,5,Nyc product
1224,5,Battery is not right vrey fast discharge
1225,3,Dont expect too much
1226,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
1227,4,Superb quality
1228,4,Gud product and value for money
1229,1,Its slow and already started facing touch pad issues...it's extremely slow...please consider Azus or something else
1230,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
1231,4,"Laptop is good for mid-level gaming and official purpose. Design is classy, suitable for both gaming and office.  Recommended: upgrade to 500gb ssd and 8gb ddr4 ram for ultra performance."
1232,5,super very good lop top

1237,5,"This laptop is completely an insane beast,i loved it, the performance is very good and the battery back-up is also good. However, firstly to get the best out of it, please update all the laptop drivers i.e graphics, processor, mother board, bios etc, the updates will take over 2-3 hours on speed internet,  Also, because of of the 1 TB HDD, the performance is quite low, but once the laptop is upgrade to SSD and extra 8GB or 16GB RAM it is completely insane beast.

1240,4,"For the first time it was too lag.It took near one minute, sometimes more than one minute to boot. But after updating windows and drivers in it booting time reduced to 30 seconds. Don't expect it is a high speed system. In my experience it have same speed as that of my earlier dell vostro laptop which was i3 8 gen 1tb hdd 4gb ram.

1284,4,Indeed it's a great laptop looking at the specs but I have never seen a laptop which is this slow just because of a HDD. Other HDD laptop works really fast than this thing.

Display is crisp. Design is great.

1378,3,Soo good
1379,5,It is a very good gaming laptop. Awesome laptop of it's price..
1380,3,"VERY DISAPPOINTED Given the specs it should work like high end device but disappointed me a lot, it takes time to open any kind of application and if we install any sort of game then device starts hanging."
1381,3,"Without ssd as its boot drive it feels very slow when starting, and sometimes feels like lagging when tried to run few applications at once."
1382,3,"Slow processor ,only 5.9gb ram available."
1383,5,Superb Product... I bought 6 months back.. still no issues. When you run big games its working good not excellent.

1385,5,"V nice laptop but sometimes lags a little, battery is good if kept on balanced and not high performance, all in. One laptop."
1386,4,"Aside from booting issue and ram being only 6gb/5.90 its a great lap. Just place an 500gb ssd and an 8gb ram , its a beast. Spend maybe another like 7-8k for upgrades and this lap will last 4-5yrs"
1387,3,HDD is littile slow it takes more time than expected to boot Display is üëå Recomend adding SSD or SSD varient
1388,4,"Battery life Not as aspect ... but nice product and designing,"
1389,2,"It claims to boot within 30 seconds. That didn't happen. It actually takes longer than my previous 5 year laptop to properly start. If there are any tips or tricks that we are supposed to implement prior usage or take the device to a service centre for tweaks then that must me mentioned beforehand. I don't know if the seller has just provided a sub standard product or the device itself is faulty, the loss is ultimately mine.

Good Good display Games in high settings runs super cool but ram upgrade is felt. While switching from game to windows.

1397,3,"Laptop is best ,, Fantastic degine,but flipkart delevery service is very bad.."
1398,5,If you are looking for a laptop at a rate of 50k this is the perfect choice
1399,5,Super
1400,3,Cyberpunk lagging even after running on low settings Assassin's creed black flag runs at high settings Laptop automatically shut down while playing game at high setting(after 15 mins) Only problem with ram. As 6 gb is usable. Need to upgrade.
1401,5,Good but sometime works slow
1402,1,Very slow. Startup takes 15 mins.
1403,5,"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop . Great performance , with hdd it just takes 20 or 19sec to boot up initially Display - is superb it has led display Sound - loud and clear Batter..."
1404,5,Good
1405,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
1406,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
1407,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
1408,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
1409,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
1410,5,Super good
1411,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
1412,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
1413,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
1414,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
1415,4,Good
1416,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
1417,5,Best Product Truly
1418,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
1419,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
1420,5,Just amazing
1421,5,The best
1422,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
1423,4,Nice
1424,3,Battery backup is very worst
1425,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
1426,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
1427,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
1428,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
1429,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
1430,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
1431,5,Very nice products
1432,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."
1433,5,Only upgrade to ssd and it will be a rocket
1434,4,Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.  One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.
1435,4,It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money
1436,5,Excellent product
1437,2,Microsoft office home & Student not installed in this laptop.Buy seperately cost 8000 Rs.
1438,4,Great
1439,1,Vesy slow performance unexpected from HP
1440,5,Go for it if you want a good laptop for gaming and video editing
1441,3,Lagging not satisfied with the product
1442,3,This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.
1443,1,It claims 8gb ram but only 6gb is usable. The processor gets very slow eventually.. Not good for gaming
1444,1,Third class laptop no refund
1445,5,Good machine in this prise segment I suggest only this device
1446,5,ALL ARE GOOD. - Only things what I am Missing... Is SSD - Awesome laptop with very good performance - Got this @46 in Diwali Sale..
1447,5,Great performance and looking too good
1448,5,"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you..."

1454,5,Except battery all are good in this price range... U can buy it
1455,3,Overall Nice but it will hang when you will run multiple software and chrome
1456,2,After 2months use... Trust me guys the system is too slow and my old pc with 2 gb ram was faster... Tried calling the customer support many times and no resolution the laptop is still slow. Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares. Battery hardly holds for 2hrs drains like anything and even when I fully charge the laptop and it's turned off ...

1459,5,Too good lapi.. I love it
1460,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."

The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
1463,5,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
1464,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1465,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
1466,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.  I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks..."

1468,5,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1469,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1470,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
1471,5,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...

I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops.

1474,5,"This is one the best product Iam buying from flipkart thanks for the retailer ""truecomm"" I was worried how will me laptop be. But once I got my product it was fresh and branded. I bought this in big billion day offer for a cheapest price. This MacBook Air apart from everyone's negative view is a great laptop. If you are a gamer go for something else. This looks so good."
1475,1,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you. As majority of the functions in Excel won't work on this product. I have been told by the apple support to install Windows OS üòÇ instead if I have that kind of work  2. in case you are a gamer don't purchase this product. Processing is not optemized to ensure ...
1476,1,Nice product awsome look and performance as i expected to be But my charger is heating up‚ô®‚ô® very fast As too much that i can't hold it
1477,4,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
1478,5,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...

It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works.

Well an apple it is. So doesn't need any introduction. I have been a window users since the very beginning so a pleasant change for me."
1486,4,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products. Now coming to this Macbook Air A1466, this product is outdated with it's features and you don't get any authentic supplies like screen, Dock or landing zones, etc. from a third party vendor.

I bought it at 52k. I have ipad pro 9.7. If you want to buy it. Go for it. Save 50k for Ipad pro. This ipad will work as extra monitor for you as well as tablet too. Editing in final cut pro is good but not tried much and..."
1488,5,"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth. After using an apple product there is no going back because they are awesome, so think before you buy because your life is going to start becoming expensive üòÇ"
1489,5,Stylish elegant and attractive.  Owsome laptop by Apple and good to use battery life and laptop performance is owsome.  Most owsome part is his trackpad the way Apple think and design the laptop trackpad is owsome.  You can not find it any other laptop.

For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery..."
1494,5,Best laptop at best price... i got it at 43500 amazing it is :)
1495,5,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."

1507,5,Great Product. Delivered in proper packing and Delivery boy was very supportive and helpful
1508,5,"Superb machine for entry level computing. Unless you are too much obsessed with Windows OS, it is time to shift to MAC OS and it works great. Yes you can not run pirated softwares on Mac. But it is worth a try."
1509,5,"What can I say?? Its a beautiful piece just built amazingly. Love the track pad which is so soft and even though the screen is small and old, its worth every penny. Just buy it."
1510,5,"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings. I use this Mac for all of my work like UI & UX Designing, 2D & 3D Animation, 3D modeling in blender, Video Editing etc. And it works great. You will find a bit he..."
1511,4,"I was really excited to work on MacBook Air . The desig. js flawless ; it's lightweight , slim, gives a premium look , the touchpad design is also very simple , elegant and sophisticated . the issue which is troubling me now is the heating issue and the battery backup. There is a considerable heating issue in this laptop . Also the battery backup is really bad. So if you're to work for long hours , you'll always have to carry your charger along with you . Else the design and performance is ..."
1512,5,"I was confused between this and MacBook pro. If you ain‚Äôt going to use it as a professional 4k video/photo editor or a hard core gamer go for MacBook Pro.  If you does light editing ( 1080p or less) for your YouTube channel and normal photoshop editing your photos, this machine works perfectly fine. Go for it without any doubt.  Pros: - Very Light weight - Great Performance - Cheapest Macbook available - SSD drive - Has MacOS (Virus free OS) - Great Apple ecosystem if you use iPhone and..."
1513,5,I love this beautiful machine very powerful and perfect choice for iOS developer. Highly recommended for start development for iOS application.
1514,5,"Pros: Pretty much everything. Light weight, super smooth, amazing display, high performance etc. Cons: Less storage space. But it's working fine for me. even though I've installed lots of programming softwares including UNITY, Android Studio & xCode. ,"
1515,5,"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t..."
1516,5,"A very good introductory Macbook. More than enough for day to day requirements. Light, thin, easy to carry and the refined Mac OS is a pleasure to use."

1521,5,"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs. Apple always integrates software and hardware better than other company in the world.  Con: the operating system needs some time to get adjusted to. But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience."
1522,5,"apple macbook air mid 2017 is well known compact business machine. It weighs around 1.65 kg. It comes with Sierra mac os, upgradable with Mojave mac os.

1526,5,"Before buying Macbook, first anaylse your requiremnets. If you want a descent laptop with highest battery backup and which can be easily portable and you don't want it for gaming purpose. Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open. Also if you are switching from windows to mac, then you will see the vast differences and you will love it. In short its a perfect laptop for general task such as do..."
1527,4,"first time Mac user, performance wise far better than my old window laptop,look should be improved wrt the bezel rest are good. battery backup mentioned around 12 hour but it's around 8 hour with normal usage which is fine I guess. good for people who want to use premium laptop within reasonable budget."
1528,5,"It is perfect in all ways if anybody want any laptop. Then it is the best because it, itself inspire us to work"
1529,4,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1.

The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...

1532,5,Wow the best laptop I have ever used!! It is an excellent piece of work done by apple. Mac os is simply the best os in the world. Once a Mac user always a Mac user.
1533,5,Apple..The name is enough to describe it's experience. it's awesome ... Very slim and smooth surface. just in love with it.
1534,5,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.

1536,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"

1539,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
1540,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
1541,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
1542,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
1543,5,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
1544,4,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
1545,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
1546,5,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
1547,5,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
1548,5,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
1549,4,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1550,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
1551,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
1552,5,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"
1553,4,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1554,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1555,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"
1556,4,"Good product for software developer .when i used this laptop for web development and software development like python and its library its quite good for that.it also good for simple deep learning model creations and data science project . storage is less . its fast compare to windows i5, its smooth compare to windows any machines . but when i used this laptop for virtual machine it is not quite good for that bcz of less storage and i5 processor .when u used this laptop for virtual machine bat..."

1558,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."
1559,5,"- using for coding and Xcode work well in this - space is little less , we take back in 2 months - design is great - 2017 model we get and registered into apple support website - great for browsing - for photoshop designing not so good"
1560,5,"If you are looking at a laptop with good performance and good battery life and want to do programming this laptop is for you. There are some pros and cons in this laptop.  Pros : 1. The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3. Battery life is good it gives 6-8 hours of battery backup 4. Keypad is very lite and doesn't make soun..."
1561,5,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
1562,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1563,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1564,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1565,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1566,4,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1567,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1568,5,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1569,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1570,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1571,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1572,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1573,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1574,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind.

Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1581,5,it's just a nice product
1582,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
1583,5,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design .

1587,2,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted
1588,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1589,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1590,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1591,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

ALso the delivery person just ran away without even taking my signature. this is a security flaw , how do we know that packet was handed over to customer. if delivery boys are signing delivery receipt themsleves then it is a big issue. thankfully -I have reveived a genuine August 2018 imported MacBook.

1601,5,The product received was well packed and safe. The best part was it was Sept 2019 imported so not that old piece. I basically am not a very heavy user of laptops. Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
1602,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1603,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

1605,1,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.
1606,5,"Classy product. Using MacBook for the first time. Amazing delivery by Flipkart. Got a day before the expected date. It has been just few hours if using and I am loving this.

1624,3,"very less storage,poor display and no useful free app available in Apple store. most important MS office for Mac book very costly"
1625,5,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products. Being able to unlock my laptop using my watch is great. It‚Äôs pricy, but I guess you're also paying for the brand When you think of Apple you automatically think expensive if your anything like me. When purchasing this lap..."
1626,3,actually the product was good but I have the concerned about the battery battery is not like what they have describe it like 12 hours of full day work battery life but I guess there is like you can use for 4 hours continuously but no after that you need to connect the charger otherwise is good but battery is not good

1633,3,"I got a faulty product. The delivery was fantastic. Packaging was perfect and the experience of a mac was superb. However, the usb ports do not work for me which is a disappointment. I will now need to carry it to a service centre or apple store and get it replaced. I noticed it a couple days later since I didn‚Äôt try usb. So, this makes my experience a little bitter. Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate"

1651,5,"simply. the best laptop. using it for general purpose as well as python programming. has been a delight so far with quick battery charge. ease of use ,sleek looks and amazing performance"
1652,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1653,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
1654,5,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
1655,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1656,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."
1657,5,I Love Apple Products it is perfect match for my old I phone 5s and redmi note 4 this is awesome slick laptop and very beautiful
1658,5,"Its awesome. Use it to feel it . Switched from windows to Mac. Great UI . Handy ,simple , lovely product. Apple continues to prove itself unique, best. Flipkart delivery is fast ."

1662,5,"absolutely awesome and ideal laptop for any college student ( except civil , mechanical engineer and architect as you guys should go for MacBook Pro as you will require extreme computing power for your designing projects) due to the fact that despite being bit underpowered on paper the permonance is as good as any windows laptop of 16 gb RAM and 8th generation i5 processor. Unless you are a hardcore gamer and can not afford the price, DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER LAPTOP other than MacBook Air if you ..."

Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
1668,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."

1679,5,"This is the best budget Apple laptop one can get. Pretty light weight and great for everyday use. I have another pro - so 128 GB was good enough in my case. However, I would suggest 256 GB to be at a comfortable spot. Performs just great and battery life is excellent."

Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
1682,5,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

Hard disk only 128 GB But these cons are not that sig...
1687,4,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

1717,5,Flipkart is an authorized re-seller of apple. and you are getting huge discounts here. What more to say?
1718,5,Best laptop i ever bought...battery life is just extraordinary...super fast processor...SSD128 is more enough if you have an external HDD....only con is the display..could‚Äôve built a better display for this fantastic product. This review is after using the product for 6 months.
1719,5,Worth for price & pretyawesome for apple passiinates
1720,5,"Got this product on Big Billion Days offer for Rs.44,900. That's probably the most excellent offer considering it's retail value at 66K. This is my experience after 15 days of use.  About the product,  DESIGN - With the everyone's favorite beautiful apple logo, it's got premium touch. It's well built. Its Sleek. It's Elegant. One of the most beautiful machine you'd ever get your hands on to. Ultra slim. Ultra light. You'd barely feel any weight of your bag. Extremely portable. If you are a ..."
1721,5,I just love this
1722,4,"Review after six months of usage: My personal opinions are in the form of Q&A to give you guys a better understanding :-  Q. Am I an apple fan boy writing this review? A. NO. Definitely not. And I don't think I will ever be.  Q. Why this laptop? A. I was looking for laptop which would allow me to my daily casual stuff, like surfing the net, replying emails, presentations, and yes one very important aspect, I love carrying my laptop around because of me travelling often, so a long battery life..."
1723,5,MACBOOK AIR (highly recommended) go> It> And> Buy> It>
1724,5,Excellent Storage is not sufficient
1725,5,The machine is simply amazing compared to any other machine. The OS is clean and fast. The display is also good. The keyboard and track pad are smooth as honey.  Had a few mild scratches its kind of ignorable.  Thank you Flipkart and Apple.
1726,5,Really loving the experience...Just loving itüëç
1727,5,"Fast boot time , excellent display, no slowness, definitely good."
1728,4,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."
1729,5,Thanks flipcart I am very satisfied with this product
1730,4,The 4* is because the magsafe (the adapter) is getting heated while charging...
1731,5,"Best laptop I ever seen, best performance,... Good product, Thanks to flipkart but the demerit is price is updown everytime ,I brought this product of 61990 but now the rate is down..."

1735,5,Superb superb graphics great music for production logic pro but need a harddics
1736,5,Flipkart delivery was frustrating. Ordered on 25th Oct and received on 3rd Nov. But wait was worth. Shifting from Windows to Mac was a big decision. And all I can say that Mac is super fun. Go for it.

1741,5,probably the most wise decision of my life! Excellent performance ! simply beautiful!
1742,5,"Worth every bit. If you're looking for a laptop that is fast - avoid Windows it can't multitask. MacBook hardly takes a second to start up. Can multitask without hanging and is sleek, light and has a longer battery life than my previous Windows laptop. It's been 2 months I'm using this and it is as smooth as butter."

1762,5,"Hello there!!! This product really rocks. I don't have to write much about apple products which is known wide already but as a first time MAC user I am very much impressed. To be frank I was worried upon the negative review of this lap top where people have mentioned about heck a lot of complaints on the product build quality and performance. But after using my received item, I feel much satisfied not the laptop. It is just like handling a mobile but in the form of a lap top and very addicti..."
1763,5,Perfectly designed for business travelling people.
1764,3,if you are really serious about display quality then it is quite disappointed for me when i first open and expected a good display .. if you have budget go for retina display
1765,5,Excellent.

1767,5,Genuine product love it
1768,5,"If you love the iOS environment, want superb connectivity with your iPhone, this laptop is the best deal out there. Of course if you have the bucks, the other mac models are awesome too. The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
1769,5,Good product with this price 56k
1770,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
1771,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...
1772,5,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"
1773,5,Worth the offer!
1774,5,Good.
1775,5,Nice product
1776,5,Awesome product ...great...
1777,5,"At 45k pricepoint its the best. Lightweight as name suggests. Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

The product arrived to Kochi within 24 hrs of placing the order however it got delivered on the third day of reaching the city. It would have been just WOW if delivery was within 24 hrs of reaching the city.  The packing was very good and its import date is of Aug 2017. The os got upgraded to high sierra on updation.  The exchange o...
1781,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac. But believe me it's not that difficult. I had few issues in the beginning but you can always Google it and find the solution. Also Flipkart did the good job of delivering it as per promised.
1782,5,"thanks flipkart ,for this beautiful product.i got this product for 50k.it simply amazing,light weight,and gives charging upto 9-10 hours.sound quality and bass is absolutly good.only problem is getting slightly heated up.remaining all is simply superb."

Thanks Retail net and Flipkart"

I hope it will not disappoint you if you are thinking buying it. kindly do check about latest model as well. This is 2017 model though you can go with this as it has all the regular updates which Apple provides.
1799,5,It is as amazing as a laptop can be. Buy it for daily use and work purpose. Gaming is not possible. Battery life is phenomenal. Works like a charm and is a 2017 edition. Great buy. Received on time and with great exchange offer.

1802,5,A great product from Apple. I bought it just to give it a try to Mac and now I am never going back to windows ever. Soon I will need a pro version though. The specifications are on a lower side but the experience is so good. Worth every penny.  received a cashback of 10500. Great deal

1819,1,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
1820,1,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.
1821,5,"Thanks Flipkart, Good time delivery. Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."
1822,3,"A very nice laptop but is overpriced.The maintenance is too damn high.I bough this in 2018 and in 2 years this laptop broke down two times,both during june july month.The service centre told it's a common problem with macbook air.The first time it crashed it was still in warranty period and hence was repaired for free. But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."

Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty. I contacted flipkart for resolving the issue and i was promised that issue wou..."

1841,5,"light , fast and easy to handle, good purchase"
1842,5,"No comparison with any other laptop for any task. Best machine for coding, graphic designing and business use. But, If you need a laptop for professional video editing and can spend some more money, Go for Macbook PRO..! Otherwise MacBook Air is best laptop and value for money"
1843,5,Very good
1844,5,"I am a software developer, It works fine for me."

1847,5,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
1848,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
1849,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
1850,1,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
1851,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.

1872,2,Laptop is really good. I've bought it 2.5 years ago and working fine for first year and then suddenly I was unable to start my Mac. Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.
1873,4,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

1896,1,"It stopped working after 1 year 2 months all of a sudden. And when I took it for repair, they demanded 40k more for the repair.  That's not the quality I expect out of Apple."
1897,5,Damn cool! my best decision for buying this in 2019.
1898,5,i bought it for 48090 using exchange offer and for that price it is awsome laptop premium built and very light weight and flipkart delivery was also good as i got it in about 4 days
1899,5,Amazing Product at amazing price 44k on billion days sell.
1900,1,"flipkart is making fool to people. some thing they commit, at the exchange time they want new product. even after paying difference amount they are not ready to provide revised invoice . this is cheating .."
1901,5,amazing and so nice and slim laptop.
1902,5,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."
1903,2,"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."
1904,4,been using it since 12-Aug and seems to be perfectly good Apple MacBook Air...seems to be a good investment
1905,5,"There is no question about the product, simply its awasom. And satisfied with filkart's delivery also."

1909,5,Got genuine product for 45k Im soo happi
1910,5,awesome truly amazing loved it
1911,2,I am posting this 1 star not for the laptop but for Flipkart..They keep exchange offer and expect that customers will give them a brand new product in return.The pick up guy comes and cancels for scratches
1912,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
1913,5,Cool üòéüòé nice product
1914,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
1915,1,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
1916,1,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
1917,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
1918,2,It work slow
1919,1,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
1920,1,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
1921,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
1922,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
1923,1,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
1924,4,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
1925,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
1926,5,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
1927,5,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
1928,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
1929,5,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.
1930,1,I agrer that not all with believe... but after one year you will face issue while turning the PC ON...U go to Apple Store and you willl find 5-6 persons around u complaining samr thing.. Better have another option

1936,5,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
1937,4,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
1938,5,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
1939,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
1940,4,so good
1941,5,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
1942,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

1950,5,"When this laptop was not there I used many laptops like Dell, Lenovo, hp, etc. But after using this one the world has a change of mine, I am learning something new day by day. One thing I want to tell you that the Windows OS is just one type of box in front of the Mac."
1951,5,Best laptop ever for students using it from last 2 years and it still feels like new. amazing performance and battery life.
1952,5,If you wanna buy laptop and you budget is 60k then go for it
1953,5,I'm writing that review after using it for around 1 month on daily basis. Everything is working perfectly so far. I recommend that product.

1973,1,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

1979,5,Terrific Purchase üëå

1982,5,Highly recommended for College Students.
1983,1,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
1984,1,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
1985,1,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future
1986,1,"Came in good packaging , was happy with the delivery and checked the serial number, and found original. Then after 3 days , not even used and the keys are loose and started falling off ! Frustrating ! Paid a huge amount and the build quality is pathetic ! It‚Äôs in service Center !!!"

1995,2,"don't buy MacBook online, keyboard not working ,not repairable only replaceable"
1996,5,"I was a bit confused about this laptop as it is my first laptop. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops with higher specifications in this price range, but I'm a CSE student so i don't need any heavy laptop at all i wanted one which could last atleast 4 years and have decent battery life.

2096,5,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2097,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

2123,5,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
2124,5,Awesome
2125,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2126,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
2127,5,sexy and hot
2128,3,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
2129,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
2130,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

2166,5,thankyou flipkart for such great deal.
2167,5,Really I like this product. Nice battery backup and totally different from windows.
2168,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
2169,2,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
2170,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
2171,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."
2172,5,"Works flawlessly, I mainly use it for software development üëç"

2174,5,awsm..........
2175,5,Simply Awesome
2176,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
2177,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.
2178,5,Excellent packing by Flipkart.Product is so so good.I love it

2184,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
2185,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2186,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
2187,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!

2189,4,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

2196,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2197,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2198,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....

2201,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2202,5,Impressive!!!
2203,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2204,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
2205,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2206,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2207,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
2208,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2209,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2210,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2211,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2212,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2213,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2214,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2215,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2216,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2217,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2218,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2219,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2220,5,nice prodect
2221,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2222,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2223,1,Good product but price varies
2224,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2225,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2226,3,Great
2227,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2228,4,Amazing quality
2229,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2230,5,Very nice products.
2231,5,Good but price high
2232,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2233,5,Perfect
2234,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2235,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2236,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2237,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2238,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2239,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
2240,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2241,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2242,1,charget not found
2243,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2244,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2245,2,I think window is better system Crashes
2246,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2247,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2248,5,Superb product
2249,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2250,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2251,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2252,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2253,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2254,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2255,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2256,5,Stunningly superb
2257,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2258,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2259,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
2260,4,It's a good product but not value for money
2261,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2262,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2263,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2264,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2265,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2266,1,not good quality
2267,5,awesome product saves lot of time
2268,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2269,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2270,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

2278,5,Best laptop in 48k...
2279,1,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

2313,5,Awesome product Really superior Mac Book in all branded laptop
2314,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

2328,5,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2361,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2362,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2363,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

2429,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2502,5,Awesome laptop in amazing price
2503,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
2504,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."
2505,5,Good timely delivery by Flipkart
2506,5,"Always wanted to buy a MacBook. Purchased for 59k.  Although the model runs down to 2017, still worth every penny in 2020.  Comes updated with latest Mac OS Catalina 10.15."

2528,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."
2529,5,"The best apple product for a student, affordable. Being a commerce student (MBA) it's very easy to install & use MS office. People say it's difficult to run MS Office, it's myth. Believe me it works much better than a windows laptop. Overall product quality is best, very light weight and easy use, battery is very very good, the processor is outdated one, but that doesn't make any difference if u r upto for normal usage.

2557,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

2566,5,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
2567,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
2568,4,Awsm!
2569,4,The laptop is really good sleek design compact laptop but the charger and laptops heats really fast while charging and also when I‚Äôm using it.....

2585,5,It's quite wiser to pay more for product from Apple like MacBook Air. Flawless design and performance.
2586,3,I donno why my product is not getting validated on apple coverage site any one else facing the same problm? Btw i liked the macbook air but validation problm
2587,4,"Much better than a windows laptop Display is not so good, Performance is up to mark Battery is amazing Sound is great Touchpad is from another world Transition effects are cool Lightweight Superb build quality"

2590,5,Overall nice laptop for programmers!
2591,4,"Slimmest, Display is above average but battery is fantastic... design is awesome."
2592,4,"Battery lasts only 6 hours with latest Mac os Catalina 10.5.6. My new Mac came with it. And now battery is only about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, its great."
2593,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
2594,5,Amazing
2595,5,Good perched
2596,5,One if the best purchase
2597,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2598,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
2599,1,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display
2600,5,"Suprb Quality As expected.. Nice packaging.. Sexy design.. In case of OS ,For programmers and coders I think the bestest ever laptop I have been using .. Love uh Mac and Flipkart also for giving me a genuine product. Thanks a lot..."

2603,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.
2604,5,Awesome.... Product..... Surely go for it... Who said that Apple is not good.it's awesome... Love it.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

2611,5,This is so awesome üòä
2612,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

2619,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.
2620,1,I have purchased the product but the screen gets off in between automatically and also when i touch the screen it gives electric shock sometimes
2621,5,Awesome
2622,5,I received this macbook air yesterday. This review based on first day use of macbook air: Pros: Battery I think 8 hours to 10 hours working once fully charged 2)Very Fast charging 3) Apple customer support is good 4) Proceeser Fast working 5) Light weight 6) Sound is good Cons: 1) Display is average Suggestions: Very good os
2623,5,If u are comparing it with windows by looking at its specs just don't ...if u are getting it below 60k just go for it.and the display it is not bad at allll....battery is great...performance is great but no gaming on this machine*****video edting is smooth like very very smooth except 4k it does the job thoough...
2624,5,Except display everything is grt

2639,5,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
2640,3,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.

2659,5,Awsome product best choice for developer
2660,5,Very good for coding
2661,5,The packaging n product quality is awsone. Will revert on its functioning in due course
2662,5,"I was sceptical about buying a macbook first, but I never regretted buying one. If you are in a dilemma whether to go do this or another option. Just go for this."
2663,5,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
2664,5,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other
2665,5,I brought it to study reactjs and do some web development it‚Äôs working good as of now
2666,5,Good quality
2667,5,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
2668,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
2669,5,Nice product
2670,4,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range
2671,5,One word only! Superb...
2672,4,Very very old model MacBook
2673,5,Super as thin as air
2674,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
2675,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
2676,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2677,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
2678,5,Worthy of money
2679,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
2680,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
2681,5,Fall in love with this
2682,5,Good
2683,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
2684,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
2685,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
2686,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
2687,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
2688,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
2689,5,Nice product
2690,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."

2695,5,Worth
2696,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
2697,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
2698,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
2699,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
2700,5,Good
2701,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
2702,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
2703,4,good
2704,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
2705,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
2706,5,Macbook air is awesome.
2707,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
2708,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
2709,5,Best
2710,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
2711,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
2712,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
2713,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
2714,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
2715,5,Good
2716,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
2717,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
2718,5,Great product. Just loving it.
2719,5,Nice
2720,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
2721,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
2722,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
2723,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
2724,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
2725,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
2726,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
2727,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
2728,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
2729,5,Very good
2730,5,Good Product.
2731,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
2732,5,Beautiful
2733,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
2734,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
2735,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
2736,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
2737,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

2782,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
2783,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
2784,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
2785,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
2786,5,Great laptop even in 2020
2787,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

2920,5,üñ§üñ§üñ§ loved this
2921,5,Working Amazingly in 2019. Seller TruCom Retail delivered the product as expected.. Thanks for providing original Laptop.
2922,2,I have purchased Mac Book Air online but after 2 days Mac Book Air Screen got vertical line. Its very tough to purchase through e-commerce.

2924,5,Fantastic
2925,5,This product is very good .
2926,5,Very nice product
2927,1,Gets heated when charged
2928,2,Dear all. When I placed the order I was very confused about the quality and authenticity of the product. So after receiving the package I directly went to the Apple service Center and got my Mac book check. It is 100%genuine product.
2929,5,just amazing than i expected..it is just crowd puller laptop when you go to public places.feels so premium no windows laptop can compete this laptop in design performance .
2930,5,good

2932,4,Battery backup is too good.
2933,5,its just awsum .Nothing beats apple as far as performance is concerned
2934,5,what can be better
2935,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
2936,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
2937,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
2938,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
2939,5,Value for money.

3523,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.

3655,5,"it's iconic, it's perfect one for getting into the Mac family. new MacBook Air is not worthy enough to choose over this. surely screen is not upto date but way better than many PC's also perfect for a student. to be frank I had no expectations on it as it being a very old machine overall but in my usage I found it to be better than all PC's of that price range. all I want to say is ""IT IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC"""
3656,5,Tnx
3657,5,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

This is my first Mac laptop. I have never used a Mac before but I really like this one. There is no lag at all, thanks to SSD. Apart from the screen size everything is fine. The camera is also awesome. The screen size could have been 15.6 inches.  I will update more after using it for a month or 2."

Coming to display its bright, vibrant with punchy colours and very good viewing angles and yes it also supports 1080p videos. Now the performance its the best. in regular uses it doesn't lags and is very quick. Will update further about performance in heavy uses after a while and the user os is very simple to use.

4743,4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
4744,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
4745,4,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .

I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not?

Don't go for this if you are into high end games. Othe..."
4749,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
4750,4,"Product was good while delivering... The laptop works slow for first two days now it is ok... I like it... In below 30,000 range laptop,this was worth with windows 10..."
4751,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
4752,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
4753,4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
4754,1,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
4755,5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
4756,5,"Nice product for normal & jenuine home use only , and value for money. Proud on me for good choice"
4757,4,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."
4758,5,It's a decent product at a price of 20000. Does the job at the price point. Dont expect it to behave like i5 or i3. But overall good product
4759,5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
4760,5,"Amazing product under this price range. It's stylish design, powerful processor and budget friendly is perfect for basic use. Really thankful to flipkart for delivering this amazing product on time."

4769,5,"very nice product in this price range, no hanging issue i recommend you to install asus optimizer for a incredible performance"
4770,3,This is the best budget laptop.. I bought it for 18990 on a sale. Good laptop But performance is not as expected.
4771,4,Full laptop is very good but slow üôÇ
4772,5,Nice product üòÇ
4773,5,Very good for normal work
4774,5,Good laptop
4775,3,Design best but no light numeric and caps lock On off. Performance is lower. Betry backup Average 3-4 hour. Display Good.
4776,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
4777,5,Very nice üëå product net speed üëå osm prosesing normal looking *****
4778,5,Very nice laptop for study and design is very good with osm performance thank u flip kart

4793,1,"Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy this laptop. It's so slow that you can literally miss whole class by the time it boots and connects. It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications. Restarting this is absolutely headache and just keep seeing the circle in front. Sometimes it appears that there is no processor inside. Bought it for kids online class with basic functionality but my 'chintoo' threw on day on..."

4814,1,Booting problem add 2 3 more thousand on your budget and get good config laptop.
4815,5,very best product
4816,1,Don't waste money on this product. Its very slow. Stop inbetween your work. Takes long time to open file folders everything. Even you can't take online classes properly in one go from this device its takes large time for every action.
4817,1,Don't even consider this laptop just for cheaper rate. This laptop is a trap in this rate. Just after 3 day use . The laptop now don't even turns on. If by chance it turns on by mistake u can't see anything all blank .
4818,2,This is not good product it's prosesser is verey slow image not clear it is very bed laptop

4820,1,"PRODUCT IS NOT UP TO THE MARK AS SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE , FLIPKART SAY REPLACEMENT POLICY BEWARE THEY EVEN DONT PROVIDE THE PRODUCT UPGRADATION POLICY. VERY SLOW, SLOW WIFI CONNECTIVITY, HANGINNG IN SEARCHING FROM THE TASK BAR. MAKE SURE DONT FALL FOR THE TRAP LAID BY ASUS."
4821,1,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.

4824,1,"Not at all happy with the product as the keyboard is uplifted as in the keys are coming out, it hangs and works very slow while using Excel and inspite of being a brand new laptop it restarts very slowly.

4836,5,Fantastic look... Thank u flipkart
4837,1,"One of the worst laptop ever .Review after 25 days of use. Happens daily . Very slow at performance and requires 20 mins just to start up . On start up it nearly takes 15 mins for any application to open . Hangs continuously . Asus customer service support is also bad , they keep us on hold and never returns the call . Made the worst decision ever purchasing this laptop . Have to spend more to add accessories like RAM etc ."

4844,5,Thankyou flipcart
4845,1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
4846,1,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them
4847,2,Not upto that i want and i think so much slow processor don't buy please if you have budget then only purchase another lap top don't purchase this one with low budget
4848,1,Very bed laptop

4850,1,This is not compartable to online classes it's very poor quality

4883,3,"Bought just three days ago. Looks okay. Light weight, good display, bigger keyboard buttons. 1TB hard disk in this price. overall great. However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."
4884,5,awesome in this PRICE... looks good.. processor work good.. ram is 4GB & 1TB hard disk at that price is very awesome.. Best for first time buyers.. and college students

4901,3,"Overall I would grade it 3/5. Display colours are very dim may be because of anti glaze screen. Storage is pitiable.... even my 7 years old Lenovo has got better storage than it.

5552,1,1. Very slow. 2. Audio visual problem. 3. Key board is not visible if sitting properly. One will have to bend the neck and body to see keyboard.

5682,1,The worst laptop ever. Don't buy this laptop unless you want to burn your money.
5683,1,I have been most unlucky to book this trusting Asus over Acer and others. I was fascinated by the configuration and the comments out here but that's just marketing stunt. Felt deeply sorry for my cousin for whom I booked this. 1. CD/DVD Rom makes hell lot of noise. 2. Booting time is more than 15 mins. 3. The speed of clicking any button is sluggish. 4. This is sick laptop even for office use.

5711,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

5714,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
5715,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
5716,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
5717,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
5718,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
5719,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
5720,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
5721,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
5722,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
5723,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
5724,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
5725,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
5726,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
5727,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
5728,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
5729,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
5730,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
5731,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
5732,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
5733,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
5734,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
5735,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
5736,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
5737,4,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
5738,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
5739,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
5740,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
5741,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
5742,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
5743,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
5744,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
5745,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
5746,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
5747,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
5748,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
5749,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
5750,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
5751,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p..."
5752,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."

5754,4,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
5755,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
5756,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

5783,4,"less than decent battery backup (less than 2.5 hrs), other aspects appear ok (used for about one month till date, mainly zoom meetings), sound from in-built speakers could have been louder"
5784,1,"very bad , it hang always ,cant browse even email"
5785,1,Don't Buy.. Very Slow..
5786,1,"Here is my honest review after using this laptop for 6 months(I belong to a technical background)- Extremely disappointed with Leveno. I am regretting after buying this laptop. I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed. Their technical support team (on phone) is very incompetent and inefficient and unable to understand/resolve my issues on call. The issues I have been facing from day 1: 1. Fan does not work and hence the laptop is heating too much. 2. Blu..."
5787,1,Bad laptop.....lots of problems......it is not good as shown on paper.....not recommended at all.....
5788,4,Good at this price range. Without thinking just go for it..
5789,1,"Very slow, Battery is not good. Drains very fast"
5790,5,"Nice laptop, smooth performance , all should go for it üòÄ"
5791,5,Best in this price range
5792,3,It is good but it is slow
5793,3,antivirus show for one year but given only 1 month .
5794,5,Superb u should go for it.....without any doubt!
5795,5,simply outstanding......top class performances
5796,1,Very very slow... Fully disappointed plz don't buy. My all money is wasted
5797,5,If you have budget of 30k then go for it.
5798,4,It just a awesome laptop in budget range It good for students and for daily work ...üòçüòçüòçüòç
5799,3,Battery backup is low. Sound is not good. Performance is OK
5800,5,Laptop is good but it hangs sometimes. Laptop taskbar comes delay in screen
5801,3,Ok.
5802,1,horrible.stopped working within 3 days.
5803,2,I purchased this product 5 days before.very worst experience...bad battery life..I requested for return the product
5804,4,"Everything's are good, only the length of the charger is very short."
5805,3,"This is a nice budget laptop and looks premium.. But the problem is the battery, if you will upgrade it with better SSD and ram it will give you decent performance. it supports m.2 nvme..."
5806,5,"Design in this range is awesome. Performance is also good for normal work for students. One problem : fan is noisy , now i feel i have to two fan in room one ceiling fan another laptops fan."
5807,4,"Overall Laptop is good under 25 thousand but the problem is with its battery its battery life is upto 3 hrs maximum for normal use battery is not upto the mark and ryzen 3 processor is good for normal use, although it has FHD display but its viewing angle is not good... Main problem is with its battery lenovo should improve it..."
5808,5,nice product
5809,5,awesome look by lenovo and very fast delivery by flipcart it's loveing
5810,2,my touchpad is not working how to fix it
5811,3,"Display sucks, poor viewing angles, backlight burns through the panel  Battery life is under 4 hours  Otherwise great, Disable antivirus and update windows for faster experience, ram upgrade recommend"
5812,2,After 2 month uses it slow.googl app hi 5 se 10 minute mein open hota hai.
5813,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
5814,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
5815,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
5816,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
5817,1,"Don't think of buying this product. Trust me, you will regret to the deepest point. Highly disappointed with not just Lenovo but Flipkart too."
5818,4,A decent laptop for the money you paid üëçüëç
5819,5,Overall good performance no hanging issue sleek slim light small as per latest laptops comes in this price good with lenovo brand I use lenovo 9-8 years lenovo I have face no issue yeah price is fluctuated but good under 26-27k price
5820,3,Display is awesome. Performance bad Battery average. Overall a decent one.
5821,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
5822,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
5823,5,Good
5824,1,"System performance is really pathetic. For opening one web browser will take 5 minutes after clicking it. Not installed any softwares other than operating system and related files. As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."
5825,3,4GB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. IT SHOULD BE INCREASED UP TO 8GB AS SOME PROGRAMS TAKE LONGER TIME IN STARTING.
5826,1,"Don't go for it Bought it before 6 months, not working now!!!"
5827,3,This is bad
5828,1,"Don't purchase this laptop, running very slow after 1-2 week use"
5829,1,That product is low quality. Slow processor.no need to buy this
5830,1,"Don't buy , worste laptop"
5831,1,Laptop is too slow. Even windows 98 pc is faster than this laptop.
5832,1,Within 8 months keyboard is not working properly Full of hang problem s don't by this don't even where to complaint
5833,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
5834,2,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
5835,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
5836,1,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. Go for dell or hp
5837,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
5838,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
5839,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
5840,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
5841,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
5842,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
5843,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
5844,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
5845,1,Simply waste
5846,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
5847,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
5848,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
5849,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
5850,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
5851,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
5852,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
5853,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
5854,5,Go for it.
5855,5,Good
5856,5,Nice
5857,4,Nice
5858,5,Osome product
5859,5,Nice
5860,4,Good laptop in this budget...
5861,5,Awesome
5862,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
5863,3,Little bit slower but value for money
5864,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº
5865,2,It hangs anytime....and shut down.... processer is slow

5869,4,Camera is worst but laptop is best for all type of use
5870,3,Average performance. Poor battery charge. Good laptop for light work.
5871,5,Worth for price !
5872,2,Everything is good.. except its hanging problem... It hangs a lot... Sometimes its very irritating while working on it... I don't know what's wrong....
5873,5,Good
5874,5,Nice product
5875,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
5876,4,Best buy for this budget
5877,5,My use is only for drafting I use only ms office For me it's good.

5889,5,Good time delivery....
5890,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

5901,3,Ok
5902,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
5903,3,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

5929,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
5930,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."

5941,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
5942,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
5943,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
5944,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
5945,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
5946,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.
5947,4,Nice Laptop....
5948,5,"With 8gb ram and 128gb ssd it is superb.Baterry backup about 5hrs in power saving mode and 3.5hrs while net surfing.I loved this.1.5hrs for full charge.can be made to rotate at 180 degree ,.Fhd screen,MS Office 2019 life time license.Large trackpad.With Power conservative mode in Lenovo vantage,U can set the battery to 60% Max. and then if you forget to unplug the charger,it will not be charged more than 60% while in conservative mode.It is very thin laptop with nice looks."

5969,3,Too slow need to upgrade ssd
5970,4,Fair product in this price range.
5971,1,Worst laptop I ever had...it's slower than a tortoise. Stupid thing takes 10 minutes to start and 15 minutes to shut. No laptop service station is understanding the problem and asking more money to improvise the hardware. Worst decision ever.
5972,1,Very slow and not user friendly
5973,1,Worst experience
5974,1,"Worthless laptop, never recommend anyone."
5975,1,"Never buy this product,this device kills your precious time"

5986,1,Laptop has slowed significantly
5987,1,It's so slow . Am just exhausted because of its speed. It will consume all your time to operate this laptop. It's slow as hell. Worst buying experience. Do not buy it . It can't open a word file. I atlast broke it .
5988,4,Product is upto the mark and for basic performance this laptop is perfect

5990,2,Worst laptop. Very slow performance.
5991,2,I purchased this laptop because of it's price but now I think it was a big mistake if you are reading this I request you not to purchase it. It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine
5992,4,Very nice products
5993,5,"That's value for money......it's not a high performance machine but it's excellent in office,students,home usage,coding,light gameing,watching online content like Amazon prime videos,Netflix...ect.

I'm strongly recommend this product....lenovo is doing good work....üëçüëçüëçüëçüòä I'm happy for the product....üëçüëçüëç"
5994,1,Very very poor performance. Not even worth for 10k. At least i should have have buy good laptop with 10k worth in seconds which performs better. Very very disappointed with the product. I will not at all recommend this worst product. Please Don't go with rating and reviews. Check the performance lively before purchase it.
5995,3,"Iam using this laptop for about 9 months..... Firstly this laptop is not intended for heavy task , usually only for office works and media entertainment...This cannot be used for online class, because it have 0.2MP camera only... Don't use this as soon as booted , it take sometimes to gain its optimised state, It can't be used for multitasking, after windows 20h2 version battery about to be draining fast. If you are having experiencing crashes it is normal,, because 2.6gb of 4gb has been usi..."

6004,2,Battery is too poor
6005,5,After using 10 months i am giving review. Problem- 1.This laptop is good but if you work on multitasking its disk used 100% so you fill like hanging laptop. When you add m.2 SSD this problem will be solved. 2. Its (elan)touchpad driver is not fully integrated with this cpu so it not work fully smoothly.  And all things are good in this laptop.
6006,1,Excellent design Poor performance.. Dead slow Battery charge is nt satisfactory
6007,1,"Do not buy this product very bad not working very slow,if you want to buy this go to olx and purchase old desktop, that may be working good then this."

6010,3,It's in a very good price but the system is slow. It's not too slow but slow. Which makes it irritating while working..it takes some time to open some applications. Planning to add 4GB more d hope it works faster. Rest all good..display good..battery good..sound is low but is manageable if ur using for working purposes. Processor Goodwood at thus price

6037,3,I am writing this Review after using this product after 1 & half month. I purchased this product for my wife which she is currently using for her office work. Good thing about this laptop is it has good screen and performance is also good. Keyboard has number which is again a useful feature for working person. Only thing which flipkart promised & was not fulfilled was it will come with 1 year mcafee antivirus protection it got expired in one month.
6038,4,Best laptop under budget i am using more than 2 months I would suggest u to buy this under an average price

6043,3,"Does not come with McAfee antivirus 1 year subscription free as mentioned in product description but when raised a request by providing screenshots of product description which I took while placing order, Flipkart asked me to purchase McAfee 1yr license and then provide them with invoice which they then refunded to me in wallet, thanks Flipkart, awesome support. Tapping device is erratic, will need wireless mouse as soon you purchase this laptop. Will need to upgrade atleast 4GB extra DDR4 RA..."

6046,3,"Too slow, rest everything ok."
6047,1,"Extremely slow and pathetic laptop. It takes forever to start this laptop. I recorded the lag time for opening applications and was surprised to see how come a laptop be this slow in current times. My 1998 PC is faster than this junk. It takes 1 min 2 sec to open web browser, 38 seconds to open another tab in web browser. around 3 minutes to open zoom meeting and stabilize streaming of online meeting. This is when I have not installed any other application apart from whatever comes packaged ..."

6155,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"
6156,2,Very Bed experience with processing and battery capacity.

6161,5,Some time it very slow working and battery Draining so fast but in this price it is a valuable laptop.
6162,1,Hanging problem

6165,4,Very slow
6166,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
6167,3,Very slow
6168,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
6169,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
6170,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
6171,5,Nice product
6172,1,Worst performance
6173,4,Good.......
6174,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
6175,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
6176,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
6177,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
6178,1,Poor defect product

6181,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
6182,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
6183,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
6184,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
6185,3,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
6186,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
6187,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
6188,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
6189,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
6190,3,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
6191,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
6192,4,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
6193,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
6194,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
6195,4,Awesome project
6196,5,the laptop is good.Build quality is also good.battery is average and nicely fast charged.performance is good
6197,5,Best product
6198,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
6199,2,Worst product
6200,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out

6203,5,One of the the best product on this price range
6204,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
6205,1,Waste of Money
6206,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!

6211,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
6212,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
6213,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
6214,5,Not bad
6215,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
6216,5,good one
6217,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
6218,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
6219,5,Superb product lenovo
6220,5,This laptop is not for heavy work.

6244,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
6245,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
6246,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
6247,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
6248,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
6249,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
6250,5,All is well
6251,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
6252,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.
6253,4,Average

6257,4,nycc
6258,4,ASOOOM
6259,1,Not getting warranty card with laptop.and Flipkart not giviing any response for that really really very horrible experience of Flipkart
6260,4,Good product
6261,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
6262,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
6263,4,Nice
6264,3,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
6265,4,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
6266,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
6267,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
6268,3,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
6269,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
6270,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"
6271,3,Speaker volume is very low as of my openion rest the laptop is good for basic uses....
6272,5,Nice
6273,5,Buy it....awesome product..ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
6274,3,"Over all ok, display quality is not good, performance is not bad."

6278,5,"Very nice laptop McAfee not for 12 month, it's just trail version so u can uninstall this, Ur laptop become fast if u paused automatic updates, and uninstall Lenovo pre-installed software and uninstall antivirus.   So all is good in this laptop  Laptop start time is 40 to 50 second"
6279,4,Finally satisfied with the product at this price....
6280,1,laptop is very slow in performance and it hangs while opening 2-3 tab in chrome...don't buy...
6281,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
6282,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
6283,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
6284,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
6285,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
6286,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
6287,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
6288,2,Very very very slow.
6289,5,Fully value for money purchase.
6290,5,Good deal
6291,4,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

6299,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."

Screen size is big.. So overall product is good but as I mentioned don't go if you are looking for sturdy laptop."

6320,5,This is a very good laptop
6321,4,"Got it for 26 k on sale,best laptop for that price with a powerful Ryzen 3 processor"
6322,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
6323,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.
6324,2,Slow Laptop

6333,3,"Design is good Sometime taking time to open any applicable like office , explorer even system is ideal. Battery is not upto Mark As per price 25k it is good for this product"
6334,2,Bat
6335,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
6336,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
6337,3,Good
6338,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
6339,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
6340,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
6341,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
6342,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
6343,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
6344,4,Nyc
6345,5,Awesome laptop..
6346,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
6347,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
6348,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
6349,3,Built quality is poor
6350,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
6351,5,Very good laptop of this price.
6352,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
6353,4,Wonderful laptop
6354,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
6355,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
6356,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
6357,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
6358,3,not bad at this price

6376,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
6377,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
6378,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
6379,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
6380,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
6381,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
6382,4,Good
6383,5,It's a very good laptop at the price of under 25k Only thing is that the 4GB Ram is not sufficient for this because in 4GB model it is little bit lagging...Rest all things is good specially build quality and weight...ü§©ü§©ü§©
6384,1,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
6385,3,Very very slow and too lagging

6390,5,Value for money..... satisfied with the product
6391,2,Edited review.  Worst decision of my life buying this garbage. Utter waste
6392,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
6393,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
6394,4,Very nice product i love it .
6395,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
6396,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
6397,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
6398,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
6399,3,A must buy laptop under 25k!!
6400,2,Slow perfamence
6401,5,Display screen is not that steady.Initially struggle to activate office. Overall good budget laptop
6402,1,"You cannot open 3apps simultaneously, for the same prize you can prefer avita ryzen 5 with 550gb add"
6403,1,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
6404,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
6405,5,Good
6406,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
6407,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
6408,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
6409,5,Good
6410,1,Keyboard is not working
6411,5,Worth buy
6412,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
6413,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.

6417,3,Average Performance
6418,5,Nice Product
6419,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
6420,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
6421,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
6422,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
6423,5,Nice productüòä
6424,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
6425,4,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....
6426,1,display problem within 2 months

6433,2,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
6434,1,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
6435,3,Good
6436,1,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
6437,5,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
6438,5,Most perfect
6439,4,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd
6440,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
6441,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
6442,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
6443,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
6444,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
6445,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
6446,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
6447,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
6448,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
6449,3,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
6450,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
6451,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
6452,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
6453,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
6454,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
6455,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
6456,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
6457,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
6458,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
6459,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
6460,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
6461,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
6462,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
6463,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
6464,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
6465,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
6466,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
6467,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
6468,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
6469,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
6470,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
6471,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
6472,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
6473,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
6474,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
6475,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
6476,5,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
6477,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
6478,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
6479,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
6480,5,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
6481,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money

6484,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
6485,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"

After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.

The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

7041,3,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel.

7043,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
7044,2,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
7045,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

7081,2,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

I would rather think, this phone could had been in the price range of 8500INR to make it the 5 star. Wifi connectivity/ signal capturing is worse when compared to othe..."

7570,4,"Best phone under this budget, only Camera is not upto the mark. Battery is also good. Miui 12 on this phone could've been better, sometimes you will get to see some notification problem and the screen will black out and some softwares doesn't run so smoothly, display is good but other than that it's a fine phone. As for the Price please don't buy it for more than 11k the sellers are really greedy. I was lucky that I got it under 11k."

10049,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
10050,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
10051,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
10052,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
10053,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
10054,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
10055,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
10056,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
10057,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
10058,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
10059,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
10060,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
10061,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
10062,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
10063,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
10064,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
10065,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
10066,3,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
10068,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1.

10069,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
10070,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
10071,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
10072,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
10073,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
10074,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
10075,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
10076,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
10077,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
10078,4,First of all I really love Motorola This phone is really impressive with its design with its specifications its camera nd most powerful nd loved one is its pure stock android experience with moto customisation options there is no blootwere no adds no lags its pros nd now we discuss about its cons the review is true nd based on i m using various type of phone in this segment nd i also use motorola's many pjones   So the main nd major problem with motorola is hd+ display its really i feel if m...

10081,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
10082,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
10083,4,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.  Worth the price?10 stars....!! Definitely yes... Amazing phone you can get in this price compare to other brands.  If you are looking for be..."
10084,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
10085,5,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
10086,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
10087,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
10088,5,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
10089,4,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
10090,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
10091,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
10092,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
10093,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
10094,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
10095,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
10096,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
10097,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
10098,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
10099,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
10100,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
10101,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
10102,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
10103,4,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
10104,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
10105,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
10106,4,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
10107,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

10113,5,"Excellent device at this price. I bought this as my secondary phone mostly to netflix and other stuffs. Battery backup on screen time is 12+ hours on a full charge which is amazing. Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum.

10115,5,"SD 662 is decent processor for day to day work, work very well. No issues while operating mobile phone. Build quality is also very nice. Two major issues, 1. Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
10116,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved. They don't tune much and pictures are quite natu..."
10117,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
10118,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
10119,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience.

10122,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.

10125,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

10127,4,Best Smartphone on this Price range Thank you Flipcart
10128,5,"the very first day I thought the front cam is worst. But actually the camera provides best quality, we just need to learn how to take photos. Do proper settings The camera by default gives natural photos, we need to do changes in the settings if you want makeup and showoff selfies üòÖ"

10191,4,Very grateful my moto g30 phone
10192,5,Those who are looking decent smartphone ..classy then go.for moto G30 .value for money and performance is good..it won't disappoint you.
10193,5,Nice one... Google assistant key is available..
10194,4,Good performance
10195,4,"Go for it _________  Moto g 30 is for reguler daily usage,it's neither a heavy performence gaming set ,nor it has superb camera,sound average,battery lasts one day easily.stock android is smooth ,nice build quality (using dark pearl varient) overall it's a good phone,any reguler task thrown it performs easily.giving this review after 20 days normal usage."
10196,1,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."
10197,5,Very beautiful phon & good camera I like it
10198,5,Motorola is my all-time favourite Mobile brand. So the name is enough for me. This two photos captured with my Motorola one fusion+.
10199,5,Best phone in best price
10200,5,This phone is absolutely doing fine. Value for money.
10201,5,It's camera is decent... long-lasting battery.... Overall the phone is very good in this price....you can go for it...
10202,2,1. Takes a lot of time to charge 2. in google pay app QR code scanner not working 3. Game App automatic stopped within 30-40 sec. 4. Battery charging drain fast

10205,4,Good product for simple users
10206,4,Nice mobile
10207,1,Not looks as similar as picture. Very poor camera performance. Getting hang also. Night vision 64MP camera is fake n not working. Waste of money

10215,5,Might be good but motorola can optimise their software...
10216,4,Good phone for this price
10217,4,"Performance is good. Battery lasts for 30hrs for an average usage on 4g. Camera quality is average , you need to edit settings for better picture. In colour shots is working. Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."
10218,4,Awesome phone.. Thanks Flipkart
10219,4,"Overall great phone. But, even the Dark Pearl color is a lot light shade. It looks more like silver under bright light."
10220,5,Fantastic phone with amazing features at reasonable price
10221,4,Good for the price. Stock android experience Camera 2/5
10222,1,Was expecting a better product considering Motorola as a brand ..  Camera is worse ... Video playing experience is bad too.  20 watt charging takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to full
10223,1,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."
10224,5,Good Delivery Service.
10225,5,I just love everything about this phone Every thing on it it's super....!!
10226,5,Good mobile.
10227,5,"I am editing this review after 6months of usage.  At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
10228,1,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
10229,5,Very best quality
10230,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
10231,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."
10232,5,This phone is very good
10233,1,Very bad battery backup... Hang problem...
10234,3,Over-all nice performance with stock android. SATISFIED ü§ó
10235,4,Best quality products
10236,5,"Does the job.  Pros: Battery. Large display. Android version.  Cons: Llittle lag while using multiple apps at a time. Camera is not up to the mark but fine for this price. Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."
10237,5,very nice product
10238,4,"Phones overall performance is good at this price segment, but their camera performance in like 24 mega pixel .."
10239,1,Not good this phone battery is not good
10240,5,Good one
10241,5,Good product good camera
10242,5,I got the genuine product

10257,5,Display ok.  Camera poor. Not a good front.  Battery good.  Charging speed good.  Brightness avrage  Moto gestures ok.
10258,5,"Cemera is definitely good, display could have been full hd, but is good & battery lasts 1 day for me( uses internet a lot, especially YouTube & OTT platforms). For this price its value for money."
10259,5,For the amount‚Ä¶its a killer phone‚Ä¶if you have kids at home and need a phone for their online class and other activities‚Ä¶go for it‚Ä¶!!!
10260,5,The phone looks awesome. The stock android gives clear UI to experience. Loved the way Motorola competing against the Chinese brands.
10261,4,Overall Good phone
10262,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
10263,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
10264,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...
10265,2,"The display is not up to the mark, and the camera is not at all good."
10266,3,Better phone üëå
10267,5,"I think this is by far the best phone out there in this price range only because of its clean and near stock user interface. No bloatware, No BS. Just plain stock experience."
10268,5,This is my 6th moto phone in last 11 years. Still the same quality.
10269,5,Overall Good phone in this price segment.
10270,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good
10271,3,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.
10272,5,It's really a great purchase üòåüòå
10273,3,Camera is poor First week battery performance is very low after update your battery life increases and it performs better.

10278,4,"Color option could be better. Overall, nice product."
10279,1,Not happy with camera while using whatsapp. Kindly refund my money Not happy with Flipkart
10280,2,mobile is good but battery backup very bad whenever u charge full it's only take 6to 7 hr to down

10282,1,Don't buy this product
10283,5,Good camera
10284,5,Value for money
10285,2,"Worst Battery. Didn't even used the phone, but the battery drains like crazy. Really disappointed."

10287,5,Super
10288,4,Battery capacity low and camera üì∑ average Nice looking attractive üòòüòòüòò
10289,3,All things are awesom But camera is 64 mp it's just number not actull 64 mp like 24 or 32 mp . And other perfomence is awesom
10290,5,"very good performance ,and ghank you flipkart"
10291,4,Very nice
10292,3,Takes 3 hr to get fully charged. Battery drains a bit faster. Camera is bad in low light. Go for another options with this price range.
10293,4,Value for money
10294,1,Waste of money
10295,4,Very nice mobile i love it moto
10296,4,While charging it's having heat issues.
10297,5,"Stock android experience , worth the money"
10298,5,Overall worth.
10299,5,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
10300,5,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!
10301,5,"One of the best quality mobile at reasonable price. It is definitely better than MI, VIVO, REALME & OPPO"

10316,2,I am not satisfied this product
10317,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
10318,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
10319,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
10320,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
10321,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
10322,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.

10326,4,Lock button & phone speed performance having problem...seems phone hang even with low number app's...Poor performance Not as expected
10327,1,"Poor network, touch not working properly. Return policy"
10328,3,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
10329,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
10330,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."
10331,3,Average performance

10340,1,Bad phone Hang Battery not Bacap
10341,1,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
10342,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
10343,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
10344,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .
10345,1,Very bad performance app shut on its own i complained but no response from company very bad services

10349,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
10350,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
10351,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
10352,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
10353,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
10354,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

10361,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
10362,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
10363,3,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

It provides only 22 hrs with minimal usage and discharges from 14 to 20 percent during night even no apps running in background and mobile data is off. Also has heating issue as the temperature raises up to 46 celcius with light game only. Tried to replace the product but very poor benchmarking during evaluation. My fate to use.
10426,2,Camera is not good
10427,3,"I'm sure the camera is not 64MP,it's a trick to attract people"
10428,5,Good phone value for this money.

Snapdragon 662 is snappy for everyday use and also for playing some heavy games at medium settings. The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1.

Don't expect to get crisp photos....it produces decent enough photos. Didn't yet try multi-tasking, but I believe that won't be a problem.

Performs smoothly, battery stays for a day (standard use) , camera is decent . Only concern was the Google assistant button (which doesn't add value for my use) . Also, emergency button long press directly triggers emergency call. Took time to figure out that you can turn this off from Gestures. Overall, great buy"

11434,1,This phone is weird. Battery life is ok for one month only then it gets worse. Screen brightness is low compared to AMOLED screens. DO NOT buy it for gaming because the performance is poor and also the google assistant button gets in the way. If you turn the phone then the speaker gets covered and I think its the biggest blunder in this phone by Motorola. I have owned more than 10 Motorola phones and I think this one is the worst.
11435,1,"Diled or receive mob. no. automatically change in unusual no like 888888, 3059. 3060"

11439,4,I just loved flipkart for this delivery service. Firstly I'm not satisfied with colour of Moto g30 .

11585,1,Worst phone I ever used!!! Bought this phone only because I had complete trust in Motorola. I bought this on April first weeks. Talking about it's features; * Battery - Battery is taking more than 2 hours 40 mins to completely charged and it will drain in 1 day's usage. * Camera - I think camera they are provided is just a gimmick to specify it. A 16 MP other cameras will work better than this 64 MP quad cam. * Dispay - Nothing to say. Ultra poor!üò∂  ** I can't even use my sim properly. First...

They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4.

Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."

As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference. Battery is decent, I like this phone for the UI."

11635,5,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."

Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

It is big disadvantage to have only option of one sim and one memory card or two sim card no memory card. Secondly camera quality is bad. Image quality is not like 48 MP. Design is not very good...

It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."
14064,5,"Great phone for price range great camera and battery display is also good nice performance also the charging is also fast, overall 5/5 I will update reviews regularly this is after 2 days of use.

If you compare same configuration mobiles from other brands this is the best one as this mobile offers 48MP Camera, 5000mah, 4GB RAM, Clean UI and mainly Snapdragon 460.

14943,4,"Phone is Good, but please don't buy mobile from Flipkart and i really had a very bad experience with Flipkart delivery and exchange of my old phone. Though my old phone is perfectly fine they did reduced the exchange value. I never expected such a low class approach from a highly valued ecommerce site like Flipkart. AVOID buying from Flipkart."

14983,3,"Camera is not of 48Mp totally cheated by manufacturer. Phone is for average use, Screen is long, battery backup is average is not up to 5000mah, camera resolution is 48 mexa pixel is totally rubbish. Earlier Moto camera of 8MP is far better than48 MP, screen touches is average. Manufacturer are cheating consumer on 48 MP camera there is no any quality check. Think before to buy it is better to purchase from market. They shows demo of every items."
14984,5,Spr

15003,2,Front camera is worst in the price range.
15004,1,"This phone has number of issues. I bought it a 3 weeks before, Alarm system is not working at all.It has sound issue while during the call. Many other frequent problems occurs. I stopped buying products from filpcart."

15014,5,Good product delivered by Flipkart
15015,4,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....
15016,4,Ok
15017,4,"Overall performance good. But some features missing like vibrate when answered,apps lock. Front camera performance average.back camera performance good. Battery backup & display awasome."

15032,4,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

15039,5,Display: One gets a very clear display on this device. Good for streaming and gaming.  Battery: Little disappointed by the battery. Says it 5000mAh but doesn't last that long. Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
15040,5,Best phone in this price
15041,5,Best budget phone in this price
15042,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
15043,3,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
15175,4,Very good product
15176,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
15177,3,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
15178,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
15179,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it

15201,1,Camera is cheap
15202,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
15203,4,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
15204,4,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."

15223,5,Ok Ok
15224,5,Nice phone...
15225,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
15226,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
15227,5,Good products üëç
15228,5,"Super, Value for money.."

15232,4,Good in price
15233,5,Budget king
15234,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
15235,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
15236,5,Awesome product
15237,2,do not buy completely waste this product
15238,5,Just awesome
15239,4,It is amazing mobile
15240,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
15241,4,Alike professional
15242,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
15243,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
15244,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.

15427,4,I am being using the Boat Rocerzz 255F for more than 1.5 years and bought this classic collar but after using those for more than year there is much difference in the built quality of Rocerzz has every thing better the sound quality of mivi is (average) considered to Rocerzz . Will recommend buying boat instead of mivi
15428,3,"Sound quality: not so good. Lacking in clarity at hig volumes. Also lacks bass. Can use EQs for fine tuning the sound signature. But the default settings is not going to amuse you in any way. Battery life : Good. But for the size of the neckband, you wouldn't expect any less. It's an uncomfortably large neckband. Almost twice the size of my realme buds wireless. Also after 50% the battery drops down very quickly. Build quality: feels cheap. The mesh inside the earpiece fell off the first da..."

15609,2,Honest review !!!!  battery backup is good There is no bass only Sound quality is poor Not as loud its should be And there is no mivi logo on battery compartment As it's shown in the images Magnets are below average Feels cheap My old Samsung wired earphones which costs only 400 rupees sound better then these  Mivi disspointed me Worst neckband ever that I've tried Plz look out other neckbands
15610,2,My left ear piece is making crackle noise other than that sound quality is good 1.Bass is ok not for bass lovers 2.Mid's is best for the price. 3.Best performance is at 60 to 70 % of volume above that music gets a bit rough 4.Best in quality . 5.only for melody songs. Returned only for that crackle noise from Left ear piece

20756,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
20757,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
20758,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
20759,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
20760,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
20761,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
20762,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
20763,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
20764,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
20765,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
20766,3,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
20767,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
20768,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
20769,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
20770,4,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
20771,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
20772,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
20773,1,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
20774,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
20775,4,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
20776,4,wonderful product
20777,3,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
20778,5,awesome.
20779,1,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
20780,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
20781,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
20782,5,good
20783,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
20784,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
20785,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
20786,3,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
20787,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
20788,4,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
20789,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
20790,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
20791,4,Great watch to wear üëå
20792,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...

20796,1,they gave used product
20797,4,it's good.
20798,5,nice smartwatch..
20799,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
20800,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
20801,1,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
20802,1,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
20803,4,Good Product
20804,3,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
20805,5,Nice product
20806,3,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
20807,3,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
20808,5,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
20809,1,Not supporting for Notifications.
20810,4,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
20811,2,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
20812,4,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
20813,4,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
20814,1,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
20815,3,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
20816,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
20817,1,not support all mobile model
20818,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
20819,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
20820,2,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
20821,4,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
20822,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
20823,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
20824,5,It's a good watch.
20825,2,Very inaccurate and unreliable
20826,5,Good product value for money
20827,5,Full features for this cost is value for money
20828,2,Not good start problem ha
20829,5,Value for money. Good product
20830,4,Ok
20831,3,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
20832,1,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
20833,5,Just premium awesome
20834,1,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
20835,3,Battery is draining fast
20836,5,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
20837,3,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
20838,4,Value for money
20839,2,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
20840,4,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
20841,5,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
20842,3,Just okay
20843,5,Excellent watch.
20844,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
20845,3,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
20846,2,Connectivity is very loose
20847,5,Good product
20848,1,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
20849,5,Good product... resonable price...
20850,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
20851,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
20852,5,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
20853,3,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
20854,1,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
20855,2,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
20856,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
20857,5,Very nice
20858,5,This watch was Awesome
20859,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
20860,2,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
20861,5,Worth buying it
20862,5,It is a good product in this price range.
20863,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
20864,1,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
20865,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
20866,1,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
20867,5,It's an amazing product
20868,2,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
20869,3,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
20870,2,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
20871,2,Poor battery backup
20872,5,Best watch
20873,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
20874,4,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
20875,5,Worth buy and accurate
20876,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
20877,2,Bettery keep charging every day
20878,2,After one year display automatically damaged
20879,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
20880,1,Worst product no recommended
20881,4,Good watch...looks stylish...
20882,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
20883,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
20884,5,Good one
20885,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
20886,3,Okay product
20887,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
20888,1,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
20889,5,Awsome experience....
20890,5,Good watch
20891,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
20892,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
20893,2,Not good
20894,1,Waste of buying
20895,5,Nice watch
20896,5,Very nice product...üëç
20897,4,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
20898,3,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
20899,1,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
20900,4,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
20901,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
20902,1,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
20903,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
20904,5,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
20905,4,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
20906,2,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
20907,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
20908,1,Not good
20909,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
20910,4,Good watch
20911,1,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
20912,4,Worth it....
20913,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
20914,5,Nice
20915,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
20916,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
20917,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
20918,4,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
20919,5,Great product!!
20920,2,Not value for money..
20921,4,Nice watch
20922,5,Amazing
20923,5,Its value for money
20924,5,Thank you flipkart
20925,2,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
20926,3,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
20927,4,It‚Äôs okay
20928,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
20929,5,Good So far...Loving it
20930,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
20931,5,Very good
20932,4,Classic watch
20933,5,Good product
20934,5,It's wow
20935,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
20936,5,Nice watch.....
20937,4,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
20938,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
20939,3,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
20940,5,Nice
20941,2,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
20942,5,Nice one
20943,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
20944,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
20945,2,Don't buy
20946,4,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
20947,1,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
20948,2,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
20949,5,Wonderful bought at 7300
20950,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
20951,4,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
20952,3,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
20953,4,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
20954,1,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
20955,1,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
20956,5,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
20957,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
20958,5,Best at this price
20959,4,Good Simple watch.
20960,1,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
20961,5,Nice
20962,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
20963,5,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
20964,3,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
20965,3,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
20966,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
20967,1,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
20968,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
20969,2,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
20970,5,Very nice really good product
20971,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
20972,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
20973,5,No doubt... It's best in class
20974,5,Good one
20975,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
20976,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
20977,3,Not much as expected
20978,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
20979,5,Best in class
20980,1,Worst don't buy it
20981,1,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
20982,1,This product waste
20983,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
20984,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
20985,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
20986,2,Not worth of the price
20987,1,syncing problem with iphone
20988,5,Amazing watch!
20989,2,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
20990,1,Poor
20991,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
20992,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
20993,3,Breakage product
20994,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
20995,4,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
20996,1,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
20997,2,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
20998,5,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
20999,5,Good product received and worth of money.
21000,1,Totally inaccurate!
21001,4,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
21002,4,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
21003,5,Great watch..durable too
21004,5,Loved it
21005,5,Nice
21006,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
21007,2,Money waste
21008,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
21009,5,Nyc
21010,5,Very good product
21011,4,Nice watch
21012,4,Nice product
21013,5,Perfect
21014,5,"it's amazing, just go for it"
21015,4,good
21016,1,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
21017,3,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
21018,5,Berry ghatiya product
21019,3,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
21020,4,worth to spend on this product
21021,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
21022,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
21023,1,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
21024,5,amazing product
21025,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
21026,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
21027,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
21028,5,Supergood.
21029,5,best
21030,2,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
21031,5,nice
21032,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
21033,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
21034,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
21035,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
21036,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
21037,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
21038,1,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
21039,5,super
21040,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
21041,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
21042,5,great product
21043,5,I just have praises for this watch
21044,4,base users for a activity trackers
21045,5,loving it.
21046,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
21047,1,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
21048,1,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
21049,4,good in all aspects.
21050,1,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
21051,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
21052,4,ok
21053,1,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
21054,4,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
21055,5,very good product...
21056,1,Connectivity issue.
21057,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
21058,2,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
21059,5,super watch and nice color
21060,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
21061,4,good one
21062,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
21063,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
21064,2,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
21065,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
21066,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
21067,5,good one
21068,5,good and accurate
21069,2,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
21070,5,very good
21071,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
21072,4,Really good watch worth buying
21073,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
21074,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
21075,5,worth buying....
21076,1,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
21077,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
21078,3,working as per review but little costly
21079,3,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
21080,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
21081,5,nice product....
21082,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
21083,5,perfect for health reasons
21084,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
21085,5,go for it guys rocking
21086,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
21087,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
21088,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
21089,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
21090,5,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
21091,5,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
21092,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
21093,4,good
21094,2,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
21095,1,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
21096,5,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
21097,1,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
21098,5,great product
21099,2,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
21100,4,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
21101,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
21102,4,very good product with great features
21103,4,good watch.... only lacking call facility
21104,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
21105,2,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
21106,1,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
21107,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
21108,3,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
21109,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
21110,2,The product was not as per expectation.
21111,5,genuine product
21112,5,Great product
21113,3,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
21114,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
21115,5,awesome.....
21116,3,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
21117,5,Excellent product... good to go
21118,5,nice product
21119,2,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
21120,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
21121,1,worst watch
21122,4,stylish and fantastic
21123,4,ok
21124,5,excellent watch
21125,5,best price and good buy
21126,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
21127,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
21128,3,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"

21145,5,good one
21146,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
21147,4,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
21148,5,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .
21149,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
21150,3,Satisfied with the product.. Its a really good for all who wants to learn photography its a gem and love.... Go for itt....10/10
21151,5,"product is very good and build quality also , special thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery , best camera for starters , it captures best quality photos"
21152,4,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.
21153,5,Awsm . I'm not a professional but using of li'l bit xperience must say that best Dslr in a best budget.perfect for a beginners.image quality is too good.thanx to Canon thanx to Flipkart & also thanx to Ecom xpress for perfect delivery.
21154,5,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé
21155,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
21156,5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
21157,5,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
21158,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
21159,5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
21160,4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
21161,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
21162,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
21163,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
21164,5,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
21165,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
21166,4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
21167,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
21168,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
21169,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
21170,5,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
21171,4,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
21172,4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
21173,5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
21174,5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
21175,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
21176,3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
21177,5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
21178,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
21179,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
21180,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
21181,5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"

21185,3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
21186,5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
21187,4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
21188,4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
21189,5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
21190,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
21191,4,it's awesome gift... always thnkful papa..I feel very happy .. it's good working...and very clean photo..

21193,5,As like always Canon is perfect in all manner.. super pick by this price range. loved it
21194,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
21195,4,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
21196,5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
21197,5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
21198,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
21199,3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
21200,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
21201,5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
21202,5,Very nice camera üì∏ for beginners and picture quality is very good and it's worth buying and build quality is very good üëçüëå And Best camera for family üòä I use this camera from 1 month and I am very satisfied with the camera üì∏ and worth buying with 18-55 lens
21203,4,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
21204,4,"Best Entry Level DSLR in this range. My first DSLR. Loved It. Good delivery, thank you Flipkart !"
21205,5,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"
21206,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
21207,5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
21208,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
21209,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
21210,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
21211,4,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
21212,5,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
21213,5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
21214,5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
21215,5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
21216,5,Good quality product for the price. Photo quality is commendable and iinbuilt wifi is an advantage as it can be used to wirelessly use camera for capture and data transfer. Even the video quality is very nice at1080p.

21470,5,Good
21471,5,Good for the price but I would suggest if you have money then go for 1500d. Can capture decent picture but the display size and color production is very poor if you compare it with 1300d or 1500d.  I have attached some sample shots. For more sample shots you can visit (Abhinav____ on instagram)

21477,4,Good 1
21478,5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
21479,5,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."
21480,5,Good to start
21481,5,"Got it for 20k flat ! Excellent product for beginners and learners ! It even comes with a free learning courseware subscription the box ! Only thing tou need to take care is that the Mount ring lacks steel reinforcement, so lens changes need to be carefully done...."

21513,5,nice DSLR
21514,5,Superb camera.
21515,5,Budget camera
21516,1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
21517,4,good

21535,5,very good camera in budget
21536,5,good
21537,3,Pixel quality bad when image zooming
21538,2,"Don't fall in trap with the price,get a used camera,that would be a better option.U can get a 600d or 700d or sony a5100 in this price range with 18-55mm and a 55-250m lens.Think about the future use,u can not plug in mic,it does not have autofocus u can not record videos at 60fps in 1080p also its low light performance is worst.Please don't buy this.Ibought it and now i am regretting."
21539,4,It‚Äôs worth the Price .. leave the kit lens Have to buy separate lens which will b too good with EOS 3000D
21540,5,Nice

21551,4,Love it
21552,1,If you're Planning to buy this camera for video shoot then you are going to do a big mistake because it's video quality is too much poor .
21553,5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
21554,5,Blur system is very good
21555,4,Good
21556,5,Good product
21557,5,So Nice.I love this
21558,3,Camera is good but storage is not enough camera quality is very nice this is expensive but according to price features very less.

21562,4,Awesome in this price range great quality
21563,5,Good
21564,5,Very good photo
21565,1,Wast of mony
21566,5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
21567,5,Best dslr in low Price
21568,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
21569,4,Excellent product
21570,5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
21571,3,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
21572,4,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
21573,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
21574,5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
21575,5,Good product
21576,4,Excellent product the picture is much more good
21577,5,Very good
21578,5,Nice
21579,5,Good for entry level. I bought is super cheap at 19k. Wait for offers.. if want a bit better one go for 1500d

21711,4,"One of the best DSLR cameras for the beginners although I don't know much about photography took this camera as it was there in incredible deal of 20,000. The camera has no built in flash you have to buy a seperate flasher from the market or from Flipkart. The packing and the delivery from flipkart was smooth."

24446,5,"Awesome product. If you are looking for semi-pro DSLR you can buy this without it thinking. Easy handling, easy handy features"
24447,5,"Great camera!!! Took some time to understand all the basics of photography... Its giving good quality pictures. I shoot raw, and post processing the images are coming really well. Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me... 300mm lens is OK... need to get another one since i mostly do birds.. need more zoom üòä Overall its a great camera for beginners!!!!"
24448,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
24449,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
24450,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
24451,5,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
24452,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
24453,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
24454,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
24455,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."
24456,5,"Excellent wow, what a camera! value for money, must buy. best entry lebel camera. flipkart delivery is so fast. very good packaging. no 1 genuine product."
24457,5,"Best DSLR üì∏ on this range üí∞, I think nikon provide best product in DSLR. Picture was so good I just love with this DSLR"
24458,4,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...
24459,5,Very Fast Delivery by Flipkart nd Service! I like it! Nikon D5600 Is Super Camera In this Price Range! I Really Happy With My New Nikon D5600 DSLR! It's Amazing Cemera! Picture nd Video Shooting is Superb! If You Are Search Entry Leval Camera!? In This Morden Life!? So it's A best Option For You! I Really Love it this Product! üëçüëå

24461,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
24462,4,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
24463,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are 1. Articulated Touch screen. 2. Wifi transfer. 3. 39 AF point  Just go for it. Its a big plus. check o..."
24464,4,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
24465,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
24466,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
24467,4,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
24468,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
24469,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
24470,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
24471,5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
24472,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
24473,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
24474,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
24475,4,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
24476,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
24477,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
24478,4,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
24479,5,Camera nd picture qlty is so nice. Delivery is also fine. This camera fullfill all the need. It work fine nd battery backup also fine. Nikon is best for Picture Quality and colours.
24480,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
24481,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
24482,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
24483,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
24484,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
24485,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
24486,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
24487,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
24488,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
24489,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
24490,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
24491,4,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
24492,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
24493,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
24494,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
24495,5,Great product from flipkart and delivery period is very short I just loved flipkart delivery time period.... And also I wants to thank flipkart for the free gift of Samsung Bluetooth headfone.. And have got the Bluetooth headset with the nikon d5600....now just wants to click and enjoy my photography with the camera....
24496,5,"This one is master of Photography with Dual Kit Lens set, it is an amazing tool... awesome picture quality.  good sensor, nice shutter speed, larger range of ISO variation, 60fps video @1080P...makes it an awesome camera"
24497,3,"camera is 5 *, you can read enough on the net. Got at a very good deal , seller also shipped it on time but the courier ecom express delivered late , the outside box (carton ) was also damaged. Thankfully the inside packaging was good enough to prevent any damage. Flipkart and seller should ensure they send it via a reliable courier. I guess people will be willing to pay shipment to see their expensive items delivered on time and w/o damage. Btw I didnt receive any samsung headphone with the ..."
24498,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
24499,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
24500,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
24501,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."
24502,5,"superb DSLR ,brought for my daughter very good pic. quality nd video quality with good sound,go for it without any ifs nd buts....... ...u will definitely like this product...."
24503,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
24504,5,"Before time delivery, great service flipkart... Product is great as expected... Good discount... Nice packaging, Got wellness band free... Delighted"
24505,5,Bought the camera in a perfect deal. A nice cam that suits beginner to pro users with a lot many handy features. The 18-55 kit lens delivers a promising performance. I'm very much satisfied with it. Thanks Flipkart for a great deal.
24506,5,Amazing product if one has the budget he should buy this camera with the dual lens because the combo pack is so good. The components was not even touched. and the components were also very clean and brand new the only thing that which I don't like is the proper bill with the guarantee warranty card. I don't get the warranty card inside the box so please mention that point overall the camera was good all the components for not even touched very clean and I will give this product 5 rates. Thank...
24507,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
24508,5,"I am writing this review after using one month. I have bought the camera at 42k with the dslr body & and 18-55mm kit lens. The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments. I'll highly recommend you to buy this product..."
24509,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."
24510,4,Nice camera with good features and touch screen. Go for manual mode for learning good photography skills. Skills are more important than the camera itself
24511,5,"Product is very good, all accessories are perfectly delivered. Camera quality is super, lense quality is good & brand new. 16 GB memory card & camera bag are also given with it. Lense cleaning kit is very useful & newly packed with warranty. It contains lense cleaner liquid, lense cleaner towel, lense cleaner tissue, cotton bud, dust blower and brush. The given uv filter doesn't bring any difference in photography, seems not so high in quality. Lense hood is also of good quality and it is tot..."
24512,5,A great camera for a beginner. Covers every aspect of photography. Easy to use and carry. Thanks to flipkart for such wonderful packaging of the product. I am a beginner and i have used it for 15 days n really loving it.

24516,3,"There is need to update the product description page, The product details haven't mentioned anything about camera bag, But seller do provide it. I have received the Lowepro camera bag. As usual the customer support from Flipkart is worst and pathetic , the customer support guys not only delayed my order but also gave misleading information, which leads you to regret your decision to order from flipkart again.  But, great delivery support from Ekart, the Ekart delivery person has gone beyond ..."

24520,5,It is a awesome camera and very easy to use . I highly recommend it for beginners. The delivery was on time and was it was packaged nicely.
24521,5,"First of all I am a new to the DSLR cameras.After a long search and continuous watching videos I decided to buy this camera.I read the all the reviews.Most of the reviews pointing towards the missing items and packaging.So I was ready to check the camera on arrival itself. 1)Camera package delivered before the expected date of delivery. 2)Packaging by Flipkart was awesome. 3)There is no seal breakage on D5600 as most of people wrote this one as negative. 3)Inside camera box,all items as per ..."
24522,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

24529,5,First of all thanks for Flipkart for delivering in two days. Camera is simply awesome and cute in size Light weight Beautiful architecture of camera structure so pleasant in hands never felt bulky Camera bag is provided as complimentary which is a good thing Battery backup is good too I am a beginner so I can't give technical review But I have heard from so many people this is a best camera to become a pro and even I felt the same Touch screen is awesome

24545,5,Amazing experience of this dslr camera . Great clarity in photos . Five stars from my side. SnapBridge app make available photos transfer to the phone directly
24546,4,Nice DSLR. Bag provided is Lowepro NOT Nikon. But lowepro bag is of very good quality. There are two lenses. Nikon in their India website says the following : E-COMMERCE WEBSITES/PORTALS ARE NOT OUR AUTHORIZED PARTNERS/ DEALERS IN INDIA FOR SALE OF NIKON PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES. We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015. Who knows what changed after that.

24782,3,"Everything in the camera is good, but if you buy this from store, a Samsung bluetooth headset worth Rs 3000 is complementary with any DSLR camera, but if you buy from here seller doesn't send the bluetooth headset. This is the cheating as nikon himself is giving complementary headset, then what is the problem with seller for sending the same. Camera is fantastic and both the lenses are working superb. Thanks"
24783,5,NICEEEE CAMERA
24784,5,"In the Entry level DSLR category, this is the best option. D5600 is compared to 200D, but in real word 5600 fairs much better in all areas. Go for it!!"

24786,3,camera is fine but the free Samsung Bluetooth headphone was not provided
24787,5,"Everything is ok, but I got a camera backpack instead I wanted a sling bag to carry my camera. Now this sometimes make me uneasy to carry both laptop and camera together. So if you are looking for a backpack with the camera then no doubt, go for it but if you want a sling bag then, i think you should confirm it first from their services. Happy Clicking!"

25038,4,Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.

As you never know which lens you may need. 70-300 gives you great pictures. I always intend to use it only. Most of my shots are shot by it. 18-55 is used for close and wide shoot. 1 main disadvantage is that remote can't be connected to this camera.

25571,5,"Awesome camera. Even the low light photos are great with the kit lens. I am wondering what wonder this will do with prime lens. And one very important thing, The lenses for Nikon are way costlier than the Canon's. e.g. 50mm stm lens for canon is priced at around 7500 INR but 50 mm nikkor 1.8 g lens is 12500 INR, so choose the camera wisely. And if that does not bother you, you can buy this for sure. You will never regret the decision."

Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi..."

26139,5,super Good delivery and canon printer is Good Quality.... value of money.. best product..
26140,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
26141,5,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
26142,5,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
26143,4,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
26144,4,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
26145,5,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"

26156,1,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
26157,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
26158,5,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
26159,4,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
26160,5,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
26161,5,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
26162,5,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
26163,3,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050
26164,4,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
26165,3,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
26166,2,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
26167,5,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
26168,2,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
26169,5,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."

26171,5,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...
26172,4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
26173,4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
26174,5,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
26175,1,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
26176,1,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options. I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
26177,4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
26178,4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
26179,5,Packing is awsome ! Prints a bit slow but thats good enoght for that price ! Works fine
26180,3,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
26181,5,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
26182,5,This printer has helped a lot in my projects.Tjis is a gorgeous printer that I have never seen.The owner of this printer would be very happy and in a favorable mood since from first day of buying this printer.
26183,5,Superb very friendly for personal use very fast and good quality love it
26184,5,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
26185,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
26186,4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
26187,5,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."
26188,4,LOVE THIS PRINTER AT THAT PRICE PROS- GOOD DPI PRINTING AND SHARP PRINTING THAN OTHER PRINTERS AT SAME PRICE FAST PHOTO SCANNING DRIVERS ARE AVILABLE IN ONLINE ALSO CARTRIAGES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN STORE EASSY SETUP AND HANDDLING REFIILABLE CARTRIGES SOME EXTRA ADDITIONAL PRINTING FETURES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS PRINTER'S APPLICATION 80% MAINTANNCE AND DIAGNOSTICS ARE COMPLITED BY THE APPLICATION AVAILABLE ACANING QUALITY AND PRINTING QUALITY SETTINGS(MANUALLY) BEST FOR HOME USE UNIVERSEL US...
26189,3,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
26190,2,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
26191,3,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
26192,5,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
26193,2,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."
26194,4,This product is good and very nice. at normal price and getting good quality product anyone can buy this product black and white colour print nice

26214,2,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
26215,5,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
26216,3,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
26217,4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
26218,5,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
26219,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
26220,4,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.

26223,4,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."

26236,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
26237,4,"It is my heartful review about the product. I bougth this product last month at a resonable price of Rs.2500 and after expering its performance for a month I'm writing this. This is a good product to buy on comparing the other printers at this price range as it supports print, scan n copy options it is very good n efficient one n the only lag is it doesnt have the wireless faccility, otherwise it will be the ultimate one.

26241,3,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."
26242,5,"Awesome product , quality product from canon . original , authentic product . well packed , same day delivery. good for office and also good for home use . just u have to refill cartage.. the only thing is its a lil bit slow in printing ,but no issue worth of money . go ahead . buy it !!! thanku flipkart ~!!!!!"

26246,3,its good for such a low price . but the ink ends up so fast.scanning is perfect . on time delivery .iam satisfied with the product
26247,4,"Do you believe? About 80% of people are buying product based on the review and thats how these online shoppers gain trust..  Anyways, about this product its good and compact in design. It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge. One black cartridge cost around Rs.800 and it can print only 150 pages so image the printer cost Rs.2400 but the single cartridge cost rs.800 now we can make out how we get ..."
26248,5,"The printer is good.Quality of printing is also good, easy to use and install. All the functions are very simple and easy to use. Good product and that too on very good price."

26256,4,its a good product i like it the print quality is awsome simple look copy is better than xerox machine
26257,4,I just wanted to print documents once in a while. Not a heavy user so it is good for me. It is light weight print quality is also good. Works fine with macbook. Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
26258,4,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy. The only thing that i didnt like is that it makes sounds while printing. However it is an inkjet printer, all inkjet printer does that. Best buy at such price"
26259,5,Being delivering whatever I want from the time I got it. Perfect for home/official use. 2 to 3 months now and still holding up on the initial set of inks. Good product and I do not think one has to think twice for going for it. Delivered on time by Flipkart. Thanks for bringing the product to us.
26260,5,"This one made the life easy from day we bought it, previously it was like draining money for color printouts for kids projects and each color print out costed close to Rs 10. Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy. The best was copy part kids can do by them self and color prints from system are as good as any color Xerox .  The only hiccup was ink, which would run out quickly if we do heavy printing, but w..."
26261,5,A budget printer with nice features at this price.... it gives out clarity print outs and the ink is also good go for it ......................................
26262,4,"this product comes out with the best price and best outcome. i am writing this review after taking print outs nearly 70 pages till now. it comes with cd and 2 ink cartridges , easy to install and use.

26263,5,"Nice all in one printer. Ordered it last week and got it delivered in a day to my surprise :) Nice Packaging. It comes with 2 demo Cartridges (1 Black/1 Color). Printer auto detect on Windows 7 did not work. Installation of drivers from CD is a slow process and took around 30 mins. However, after installation, the Print quality and the scan quality is nice overall. Overall it'sa great vlaue for money (I got it at 2400/-) and a recommended buy for basic printing of documents/photos/copy/sc..."
26264,5,"good at this affordable price as it offers multifunction printing, scanning n copying and all working well.. but it is good for only small consumption rate"

26266,5,100% paise wasool Product I Don't Know about refilling but rest is awesome printing quality is very good can print picture to in very good quality at this price canon and flip-kart rocks delivery is very fast.
26267,4,Printer is good but cartridge capacity is too little.also it does not have led display like PIXMA 258. for multiple xerox copy u cant increase the no of copies from printer itself. you have to take each copy by pressing button again and again and printer will scan same copy everytime. sometime its very frustrating. rest is good and be aware that cartridge will run out of frequently
26268,4,a very good printer with very good specifications gives nice prints and colour prints are excellent if you know to refill the cartigde
26269,4,"I have bought this printer,it very good option to have in home for assignment print out etc.I am satisfied with product & delivery time maintained by Flipkart. In my opinion worth having this product.  Tanwir Alam"

26274,5,I fell in love with the product the moment I saw holy matrimony between the brand and the price tag :) Its a gorgeous product and extremely easy to install (no need of a specialist). It has a scanner and also gives B/W and Colour Prints which was a surprise. The quality of the prints is also very nice and can be easily used for projects and any home assignments. The cartridge replacement is extremely easy and there are numerous tutorials on YouTube which shows how to replace and refill with e...
26275,5,"This is a best budget printer in market. Price of 2200 with copy, scan & printer  Pro's : Best Price Dedicated button for black & White / Color Photocopy compact printer  Con's : small cartridge, ink might not last for more than even 50-60 pages. you should know how to refill by self.

26293,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.
26294,5,"This printer (Cannon PIXMA MG2470) provide excellent printout as well as scan quality. It has easy to use feature, simple and clear. The software provide easy to use function. The packing is excellent an there is no damage even to the cardboard cover"

The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.  The Scanner works pretty wel..."

26297,4,Prints slowly but an awesome choice at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a printer at home. Flipkart does a great job in delevering the product on time with minimum hassle.
26298,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
26299,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time

26323,5,Nice product with good discount Does the well. Just used it for 10 days  Have to c the cartridge consumption
26324,4,"Does the job. Nothing great. Nothing bad so far. Ink consumption is a bit high. But its ok for occasional prints,"
26325,1,After 10-20 copies the cartridge gets empty. You will have to buy a new ink cartridge @ RS 499 from Flipkart. So apparantly you will end up paying RS 25 per copy.
26326,4,Best Printer Low Price Best Quality.üëçi
26327,1,bad product because its error prints
26328,5,very very very very good super

26344,1,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
26345,5,amazing and super thank you filpkart
26346,4,Good
26347,5,nice work
26348,5,Looking good and working system is very nice.
26349,5,too good
26350,1,by using two to three months its getting problems...
26351,1,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
26352,5,Very good product
26353,1,Not working properly..
26354,5,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
26355,1,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok
26356,5,very good printer. printing quality is too good.
26357,5,I take print in my hand really very nice
26358,1,for 1 month it is best printer but after one month it is so costly ink was RS.1000-2000
26359,4,"GOOD, GOOD , GOOD"

26362,2,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high
26363,5,I received good product iam satisfied let see the span

26369,1,Very poor quality of product.As printer was delivered in time but it's a defective as its not working I have placed request for replacement but they have not responded to it and saying it request is rejected .So friends don't buy any thing from flipkart they are selling defective product and showing arogant behaviour with customers and return policy is very poor.
26370,5,good quality
26371,3,"Quality is good. Two catridges are to be used. Cost is more (black1000,colour700). Not suitable for home needs."
26372,5,Canon prefect

26566,1,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
26567,1,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage

27167,1,This product is not good and ink is not refillable if you refill it then it will show error in cartridge. Only Canon company's cartridge and ink you can use in it.

27178,3,"Didn't meet expectations. Need to refill very frequently. While refilling it flows out from other end. Very less amount of ink remains inside cartridge resulting in printing for 15-20 papers only. And other issue is, even after refilling cartridge the yellow light will keep blinking. Would say don't go for this product."
27179,1,Faulty cartrige
27180,3,Very expensive
27181,1,"Waste Product, Ink over In 1month"
27182,3,It's really Good

27212,1,Not worthy & less productive.
27213,5,lovely
27214,1,Never by this product. It is really swindling to rob the credulous customers by selling them a comparatively cheaper printer and then to charge an exorbitant and unaffordable and grossly disproportionate price for the printer cartridges. The printer is never returnable as well. NEVER EVER BUY AND FALL A PREY TO THE SELLERS CUNNING TACTICS.
27215,1,Very bad product. Cartridge finish within 20 pages print. And the cartridge is not refilling. If the cartridge is finished you need to buy a new cartridge Which price is 700 and above. And no. off-page is very less in printing. Almost your per copy print approx Rs10-12 each in black.
27216,1,Printer bad working
27217,1,Very poor not working ink error .even after refilling
27218,5,This printer is very nice
27219,5,"Frankly speaking Guyzz don't buy this as for student purpose/home purpose because the cartridges is too costly and in one cartridge give only 50 sheets Afterall the printer is very good there is no doubt but not for as student purpose overall cost will be 10,000 in that you go for ink tank printers it will save you atleast you don't have to buy costly cartridges. Thank you ."

28196,1,Please don't buy this product. 1 took only one print then it's stopped to work
28197,1,It is not good
28198,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less
28199,5,Spr
28200,5,Very good quality and nice model Satisfied
28201,2,"Printer works fine, but i would recommned not to buy this as the cartridges are very expensive."
28202,2,Don't buy it. The reason is printer cartige is very costly. One cartige you will printer 20 or 25 pages only and the cost of Black Cartage is 775/-.

28240,4,Mast product
28241,3,Printing quality is awesome but the cost of printing is too much so if your printing work is not much then definitely you can go for this but if you have to print more then the cost of cartridge will definitely be high for you as it just prints approax 50 pages in a single cartridge so do consider this point before buying..
28242,5,Excellent Product

29057,4,The cartaige gets over very fast if you will take my suggestion please buy the printer having tank system non cartaige printer .

29943,5,Good in printer but the ink cartridge cost is toooo much high and cartridge printing capacity is also to low
29944,1,"I purchased this product on April 2019, this printer worked well for a month only. with 100 of b/w printing default cartridge got empty. we purchased new cartridge package of original canon ink. From then it's started showing all offset problems. can't even print more than 50+ prints and print quality also became poor. we forced to stop using it after one visit to Canon service center and repeated problems."

31297,3,Not bad...
31298,2,It is not working properly. Waste of money
31299,1,Worst product I have ever get from Flipcart. It's Ink toner has less capacity of ink & very costly to purchase. Can't be refilled. So you have to purchase the toner each time. Approx cost per toner is Rs.600. We can print only 100 to 130 pages per toner. Almost 6 rupees per page. So I suggest not to buy this printer.
31300,5,"after using it for some time i realised , laser printers are always economical than ink ones.."
31301,5,Good quality product

31452,4,Good For Home Use Consumes Ink Very Fast
31453,3,Ink exhausted too early. Improvement requires on driver software. The Printer became unserviceable within 3 years which was not acceptable to me. It seems there is a logic circuit in the Printer which prevents any more print facilities after a certain number of pages has been printed by the system.

It is better to read these reviews before purchasing a canon printers. The cost of the printer is some how less but the cartridges cost is extremely high and from each cartridge we can't take printouts more than 50 pages. Better go for Laser Jet Printers with Toner cartridges."

31947,4,Printing is good and user friendly. It has many good features. Only drawback is that Ink Catridge is costly. It costs nearly 1000 Rs. If you fill ink manually it costs only 150 to 200 only. Otherwise printer is good.

32038,3,"Ones the ink fully finished , the cartridge problem comes over , my mean when the company provides cartridge with ink and it finishes by uses but when we refill it with a proper ink, the emergency light comes to blink while we regularly pour some ink in it."
32039,1,"Don not buy this printer it is waste product,cartridges very high price. canon company worst company, poor peoples very upset who buy this product."

32041,5,Nice printer
32042,5,"I replaced my Epson TX121 with this due to some unfortunate malfunction. This printer's scanning is simply too good. It is fast, smooth, edge to edge and crisp. Printing is also ok but it does not print till corner of the page. However, I do not know it is because of some setting or it is default. Xerox is also ok. For home users, it is a good printer for just 2400/- Thank you, Flipkart"

32229,1,worst product..i have never seen such a worst product in my life...dont buy it guys...its totaly waste of money it requires lots of ink cartridge...in evry 50sheets it requires a new cartridge

32237,3,Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .
32238,3,This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..
32239,1,"Pathetic product, worst ever printing and scanning quality. Do not recommend this product to anyone, my 10 year old printer still works better with better quality output. Spend some extra money to get a better product else your money is wasted."
32240,5,"Extremely Good Product.The best print quality one can get. If you are on the track of purchasing it ,go ahead I can guarantee that you won't regret. A priceworthy and one of the best product by HP team to us .Thank You!!"

32242,5,Supob printer
32243,1,very bad product... it shows low ink after printing arounrd 50 pages and ink cartridge is very costly around 2000 rs and prints only 100 pages go and buy another printer
32244,5,Superb product
32245,4,Good product
32246,3,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..
32247,5,Very good nice printer
32248,4,Good printer but color takes too much for print...

32253,4,I like the printer look so much but the cartiage ink was empty In 50_60 pages or hp called it is only for trial purpose .or the speed of print out from pc is very slow main thing is the speed of print out from pc is very slow by the way the printer look and the photocopy speed is also good thank you
32254,5,Nice
32255,1,"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose because these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy ink tank printers as they are too efficient"

32792,4,Poor TFT screen. Don't buy it. Go for another dell monitors!
32793,5,Worth money
32794,1,"It is a LCD MONITOR mentioned on the back and not LED, but they mentioned it as LED backlit. I replaced once but received the same LCD MONITOR with the model name as mentioned. Those who want to buy I request them to see the meaning of LED BACKLIT."
32795,5,Best product
32796,5,Awesome product...
32797,5,Dell is always a great product. Clarity is fantastic. Affordable price at this time. I had bought this for my kids online class. It might reduce the eye strain of my kids.

32819,5,Awosome!!
32820,2,Couldn't connect to monitor as the power cord provided is of 15 Amps plug and normally we switch to 5amp plug.
32821,3,The monitor is good. It come with the power connector which is used for high voltage items and it will not fit in a normal 3 pin plug. Yoh need a bigger plug which is used for AC for this cord. Have purchased another connector from market for it to fit in the standard extension cord.
32822,1,"Inferior product - one of the worst from Dell. Even a laptop screen second hand is better than this. Inferior quality LCD screen parts used. Display has round white marks within 10 days. Reducing clarity of display of numbers. Not recommended to use for work/business purposes.  Power plug send with this item is not of Indian standard. It is a very large power plug, send on purpose so that the return policy of 10 days will lapse."
32823,3,"Viewing Angle is just average; It's strange that the monitor requires 16A Socket, therefore doesn't fit in the normal socket; Not LED, the display is LCD, Title is misguiding the consumers; The package was already opened by the seller; Average HDMI cable, the display looks blurred using HDMI Cable; Made in China, the printed manufacturing date was Oct'20, can't speak about its reliability at this point; Other Points: Comes with HDMI Cable and VGA Cable for respective ports, along with 3.5mm A..."

33032,3,"This is a very standard 18.5 inches Monitor from Dell. There is one important information needs to be added that the power source cable of the monitor comes with a 16A plug and it is not possible to connect to our standard UPS. Hence either the cable needs to be replaced or the monitor needs to be connected to 16A plug point, which will not help during power cut. Due to this, I have not yet been able to check/test the visuals and performance of the monitor. Hope to update my review soon once ..."

33070,4,"Overall I am quite satisfied and happy with the monitor. The only reason I am give 4 star is due to the fact that the power cable that this monitor uses is a 16A one. This was a surprise as I did not expect a monitor to have a 16A input cable l. Had to buy a converter to get it working. This delayed the use by couple of days more. But other than that, this is a very good buy"

33335,5,"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:- 1)vga cable 2) HDMI cable 3) stand for screen 4) screen 5) power cable 6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops) So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins. So here are some pros a..."
33336,5,"beautiful and elegant piece, good viewing angles, super slim and great full hd experience, thanks for the BB sale it contain 7k price, only cons its no speaker about delhivery courier its pathetic.."
33337,5,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."
33338,5,Awesome display just replaced it with my old 768p monitor. It looks very premium with perfect sharpness and good colour reproduction. I use it mostly for gaming at 1080p with gtx 1060 6gb easily pulling 60 fps on most new games. One good advantage is that due to nvidia 's dsr super scaling and it being a 1080p monitor i can increase the resolution to 4k and all games support it. At 4k the display even though downsampled to 1080p looks just stunning but my gtx 1060 can not handle 4k. It can on...
33339,4,"Very slick. I think there is no other monitor available in market with that much slickness. Left, right and top bezels are black colored, very narrow (little lesser than half inch) and covered by panel's glass. Bottom bezel is lesser than 1"", silver colored and looks quite stylish. Stand is silver colored, slick and stylish. Back side is black and mat-finished - looks stylish. I was a bit skeptical of buying a 27"" monitor for my programming work; but now I am satisfied since it doesn't look t..."
33340,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
33341,4,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
33342,5,Nice monitor it has a good viewing angles and it is the best in its segment. And even looks royal with the aluminium coloured frame and slim enough too I recommend you to go for it.... It's packing is also good and it has VGA and HDMI Cables too....
33343,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.
33344,5,Amazing Value For Money Monitor  I Use This Excellent Display 15 Days Amazing Response  (1) HDMI Cable (2) Amazing Screen (3) power Cable
33345,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
33346,5,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."
33347,5,"I really wanted this screen when I first saw this on FK and Amzn. It's super slim and has awesome display. And the offers on Flipkart were great so I couldn't resist. If anyone wants screen of 21.5"" then I would say this is the screen they should go for. Samsung and LG has TN panels in this price range and HP has come up with IPS display which is far better than any other TN panels. If you are a hard core gamer then I suggest to go with a TN panel with low G2G response time. This panel has ..."
33348,4,"Very Stylish Design. Great Looks. Good Picture Quality. Only missing thing is a speaker. Coz when you connect to HDMI, the audio output from a laptop would not work then."

33352,5,"I purchased On Big billion day .. at cost of Rs 7100 /-  1. It's was amazing packing and delivery. 2. The monitor consists of HDMI cable, Monitor Stand, power cable and Monitor. 3. Very slim you can adjust the monitor as you like very stylish. 4. 100 % satisfied I refer others to buy this product.  Thank you"
33353,5,"Do not think twice before purchasing it some will say lg display is good samsung is better, it has a response time of 7 ms which is slower than usual and u are here searching for an IPS panel monitor it clears that u want a good picture quality and video experience so go for it don't listen to any other if u take it then u will give a review here like me.."
33354,5,"Flipkart really went an extra mile this time! I am happy that they have started delivering their products to Srinagar, J& K also. The consignment was well packed and courier guy was also very polite and helpful. Will surely buy more if Flipkart also starts delivering other items like fridges, washing machines and Televisions etc to our area. Very happy with the purchase."
33355,5,"The monitor is an absolute value for money. IPS panel, full HD at this price point is a steal. HP products are reliable. Playing games on it is aan altogether different experience. To top it all, large display helps to do office tasks easily. Flipkart delivery and packaging was prompt and top class."
33356,5,"Very Good Product. I bought this product 26 Jan 2017 and i got at home 29 Jan afternoon at my door step. No Extra fragile used for this product. This LED powered with power adapter and adapter have not any HP made mark or logo, i dont know Is this original or not. But Result is awesome and product pure new and original and fulfill my wish."
33357,4,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."
33358,5,"Awsome quality, best moniter in this price, perfect & true color for photo & video, best moniter for photoshop working & video editing.. Loved it.. Thanku flipkart.. Flipkart service is very good before time delivery i loved it."
33359,4,The HP 22Es Monitor is actually pretty good and have VGA and HDMI cables bundled with it already and is very much sleek considering it already a 2 year old product. Got it for 7100/- during the BBDs and its totally worth that.
33360,5,This monitor has very thin bezel and full hd resolution and better viewing angle. I am greatly impressed with the design of this product and monitor looks stunning on the desk. I have paired it up with HP pavilion wave desktop CPU and it is over all a great looking desktop for me. The monitor is priced very well and offers excellent value for money.
33361,5,"Nice Slim Display, very good colors and uses very less space compared with other Displays. One word to the product is very nice to use this display"
33362,5,"Magnificent, it‚Äôs a spectacular piece of a product. Really happy that I have purchased due to the wfh situation and it is indeed turning out to be a great choice as I expected. The built and finishing of this brilliant monitor asks for your admiration. Just get it on and enjoy the anti glare beauty of vivid Colors."
33363,4,"I have been using this monitor for last 1 year and no compliant so far. I use it for my daily work and also connect with my office laptop.  However, there are few improvement areas which I feel could have been added to this one:  1. This is not height adjustable 2. The Power cable is too thin. You need to pay special attention to avoid cut 3. No USB or Speaker"
33364,4,"Seller: RetailNet On time delivery. Packing is just okay. Nice looking monitor. Working good. Advertised as 3 years warranty product but I got only two and half years warranty after registration with HP website. Missing 6 months warranty. Feel like Default display is too bright. So I had to adjust display settings. No complaints with Monitor. No missing accessories. VGA cable,HDMI cable and warranty card are included with the package. Monitor looks pretty good."
33365,5,Happy to see the things u like on the big screen with affordable price. Thank u flip kart and hp
33366,5,very very good monitor.. love this monitor..this monitor look is very cool ...very slim..and thank for hp this monitor sell low budget..
33367,4,"The monitor display is amazing. It's very slim and light weight. Looks absolutely stunning. VGA and HDMI cables are provided with the monitor. It definitely works as PnP and it's very easy to mount.  Cons: The one star less is for the quality of the power cord. The half part of the cable which connects the adapter and the monitor is of poor quality, looks like the cable that you can buy with the Diwali lights."
33368,4,this is the best product and super quality Super clarity
33369,5,"This is the best product I bought on flipkart and I am so happy with my decision. This laptop is just awesome. 1. Built- 5/5 2. Screen 5/5 3. Looks 5/5 4. Battery life with normal uses around 6-7 hours- 5/5 5. Performance 5/5 6. Sound - 5/5. 7. CPU heat near 35 d C at normal uses. Also there is option to increase/decrease fan speed. Which is helpful to cool down the CPU. - 5/5 8. Value for money compare to other laptop, probably best."
33370,5,Amazing picture quality. Great for working and editing. The color production is very good. Also the Led is very sleek and looks very good.
33371,5,It's amazingly superb product in this price. Thanks to flipkart and the packing also very good with the additional large box for extra safety with the fragile item inside warning. It's delivered well before the expected date. Thank you flipkart
33372,4,Its good product. However choose Dell because they have very good sharpness and comes with speakers with good sound quality. I have both ips full HD monitor. I suggest you to go with dell monitor when you get in lower price in sale.  However its also good monitor i got in 6750 in sale price at very good price. Thank you Flipkart
33373,5,Worth For Money... Good Display... Best For Gaming And Movies Watching... Thin Bezzels... Awesome Product...
33374,5,"I liked it at first sight. finally , i got it. It is the best LED you can get at this budget especially if you want to get into professionalism. Quality is good. Resolution is perfect to work on. Design is awesome. Performance is much better than i was using before."
33375,4,Nice monitor.... U get 100% video output result Oly by using Graphics card.... Without graphics card video is very poor. After by using graphics card I get 4k video clarity very nice. .. I am satisfied by this monitor.....
33376,5,"Fantastic, fabulous and exactly what I want in a monitor. built quality was excellent sharp and beautiful design. colour depth are bright and very good for designing work like Photoshop."
33377,2,Don't buy any hp products totally waste
33378,4,"Technicolor certified and there is a picture mode for that. Hence screen is vibrant and good for movies. Physical design (narrow bezel and metal stand) is also good. Good viewing angle . Got it for ‚Çπ6,699 during Big Billion sale. Worth the money  Cons  No 3.5mm output No inbuilt speaker Blacks are not dark enough when compared to Oled screens and high quality LCD screen seen in phones such as iPhone XR. But the screen produces decent blacks. Not bad."
33379,5,"overall product good , this is non vesa mount led so you can't mount directly .. you want to need vesa adapter and it's very light weight so not stable in fan wind on table."
33380,5,At the price of Rs.6600 this will be the best full HD monitor from the best PC brand HP. Viewing angles are awesome and colors are so vivid. At last the build quality is good and the monitor itself is very slim. Thanks to flipkart for giving me this offer. Flipkart never disappoints me :)
33381,5,Awesome product. I was not expecting this high quality product within this price. Best packing quality and delivery from flipcart. This monitor looks suoerb. Happy with my purvhase. Within the Box Got everything that was mentioned. HDMI connectivity working great.
33382,5,"This was for my friend. He is professional photo editor. He loves the display and the crisp clear image. Must buy if your looking for good display output similar to almost that of an iMac. It's too thin , so have to handle with careüòÄ."
33383,4,"Very Light weight, Sleek, Elegant looking monitor with bright colors and good viewing angles. Plug & Play. Packaged well and dispatched promptly too. Price could be a bit more competitive though."

33392,5,This is the best monitor at this price range. I bought it in flipkart Diwali sales. Excellent price for the range of 8100. Ultra slim led monitor with excellent display. Don't give a second thought simply go for it.

33394,3,Delivery was good it was on time. Setup and connection to laptop took just 10 min from opening to using the screen. Definitely sleek and very lightweight. Blue light single click reduction is a good feature for those who believe blue light at night may cause less sleep  But: the website says authorised technician should install to ensure 10 day replacement guarantee but when i called up support they said I can install it myself. Then why say this on the website.  The swivel is only up and dow...
33395,5,It's really great led monitor i liked it very much thank you
33396,5,Good for Home use. Stunned by seeing 1080p youtube videos. Speciality is that you can watch videos without black bars. Thinnest IPS LED monitor I have ever seen. No other option in this price range. I got it exchanged with Samsung LCD monitor. Nothing to say. Go for it. I got it for ‚Çπ8099 after exchange.  Don't know why Flipkart ships without any sort of packaging. Just a sticker pasted on the cover. Expected better packaging from Flipkart.
33397,5,"Super fast delivery by Flipkart, Got in hand in 13 hours. appreciated......  Monitor feels excellent and beautiful so far (2 days of usage)."
33398,5,"It has great display, has user friendly buttons. Value for money. Great aesthetics. I liked it a lot and bought one more."

33460,1,I am HP fan from my heart but the color of this display is not that crispy as AOC LM525. I thought it is going to be crystal clear but this display failed me. After using 45 days I can say It is not as it was expected to be. :(
33461,1,Actual quality of the product is revealed after 2 weeks of usage. Power button is not at all working. Monitor menu automatically working on its own. Can't even able to stop it. None of the monitor's menu button is in control. Just an incredible product. Selling defective products for offer???

33471,5,"I bought this monitor for my Home office. It is so smooth and crisp. I bought it under 11000/- , a bit higher for my price range and was a stretch for me, but this is beautiful.

33722,4,Nice full hd display..üëç
33723,5,Really good product.. Its valuable in this price
33724,1,Not good at all screen shows lights on the corner
33725,5,"Excellent product in budget .i m loving it.i prefer this for who is finding home theater for his L.E.D ,laptop or computer ,"
33726,5,Brilliant excellent performance thank you Flipkart I am use 10 days super product
33727,4,Its good in this price range but if you are looking for a high definition sound clarity so this is not for you and as of its cost it is best as per my opinion. one thing more bluetooth range is only 5 to 6 mts so keep this in mind before choosing this.
33728,4,"Writing this review after using 4 days.. No doubt its best sound system under this price segment. Let me tell u first, over all in this price segment this intex 4.1 channel home theater is super good. Really impressed with the sound üîä quality and Bass is very high. What more can u expect at this price. After all its brand intex. Over all you can buy this product with no doubt. You will get all necessary features.  CONNECTIVITY FEATURES ***  Bluetooth (10 m. Rang) Aux cable (you can connec..."
33729,5,Nice product. Bluetooth connectivity are very good and long distance. This speaker is suitable for small rooms in very nice experience. In this price very best quality. Very small product but sounds unbelievable. Sound very clear and good. 1 sub woofer 15 w 4 satellite speakers √ó 10 w = 4 w So Total 55 w 4.1 HOME THEATRE SYSTEM
33730,5,"Ordered this and next day delivered (Rs.1699.00) Flipkart packaging is not good in this item only a poly pack but delivered without any damages and got recently manufactured product Oct/2020.  About this product: 1) Subwoofer Bass 5/5 2) Satellite speaker 3/5 Sound is good but it is mentioned 10 X 4 = 40 watt, it sounds like total output of about 10-15 watt only except subwoofer not because the speaker but inbuilt circuit board. Although this home theatre's sound is enough for me (12X10 room..."
33731,3,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box.. If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it. If u want a home theater effect dont go for it. While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.
33732,5,Completely mind blowing speaker more than my expectations and pocket friendly I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.... Very good all features work perfectly and fluent..!!
33733,5,Nice product. Nice sound. The advantage is it have led light and 4 speaker
33734,4,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.
33735,3,"Good product valuable for money I like it, if u selecting for a better quality home theater under cheapest rate I preferd for u this b/s it's good and good quality one"
33736,2,"Good design.. I bought it in1500 so in this price ""value for money "" But according 55watt speakern i dont think its sound Average product ...but ok & perfect for this prise range Edited rivew after 6 month use i dont think it is a good product BASE Is good bt the vocal & noice is very bad sound like 10 watt blootooth sepaker"

37224,5,bass less
37225,5,Main Features ‚óè Four high gain antenna for strong signal and quick transmission ‚óè 64MB capacity for up to 64 smart devices accession ‚óè Intelligent speed limit function for faster performance ‚óè Intelligent network watching function for ensuring network security ‚óè Smart management function for remote control ‚óè Brief appearance for various home style integration I love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
37226,1,"First of all I am not recommending to buy this item due to following reasons:  1) Even though it is having 4 antennas, the range, I mean the strength of the Wifi signal is very much less than that of Netgear / TP Link routers with single antenna.  2) Most of the tools or features in the MiWifi app are not working.  3) Connectivity details are in China Language as usual.  4) It is very difficult to search for a password. Since No where it is mentioned.  5) Very difficult to mount on the wall. ..."
37227,4,These Router is just awesome.. I have used Mi Router 3c and now i ordered this one 4c.. This one is just an upgrade to the other one. But it works fine.. Not a single.issue till now using 3c from about a year and 6 months.. Using thia one from past 3 days the speed is good as per my plan no problems with any connections.. Look is also good but the thing which stops me to buy is the Company which is basically a chinese brand.. This is my last thing which i will be purchasing that is made in ch...
37228,5,"Smart features,looks is also impressive and app optimization is so good I like the overall extraordinary product."
37229,5,Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router
37230,1,Genuinely MI products are good and I am using all the products of Mi And I need to say about the MI router is after 2 weeks of usage is suddenly shut down and it is not even blinking the lights on top of Mi router I have seen a big issue with this MI router and I want to suggest you people to take the other best companies for your router I am saying genuinely to you all you have buying to take this product From Hyderabad Alwal
37231,5,GOOD PRODUCT & SOME CONS  MIWIFI QUALITY IS SUPER SOLID PERFORMANCE IS ALSO BEST AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT ROUTER HAS NEW FEATURE CALLED SIGNAL WALL PENETRATE MODE ALSO YOU CAN WIFI CONTROL APP (MIWIFI) FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE BUT ONLY I HAVE ONE ISSUE [CHINESE PRODUCTS MOSTLY SPYING YOUR DATA SO MAYBE IT'S ALSO SPYING OR NOT ]
37232,3,"Just like a normal router, works well and as expected but nothing special.  It has those basic features as of all routes which includes :- 1. Bandwidth Control for some devices 2. Hiding the network SSID 3. Total data monitoring   However, even thought it as 4 antennas, the range is very low (I am not running it on 5 GHz otherwise it will be much lower). When I go onto rooftop (just above my room) the signal drops and only 1 bar of signal is available. Not to mention it only covers the place ..."
37233,5,It's really awesome products nice design with good inbuilt feature makes it a pro level WiFi router as I have at the moment 2 system working as we are working from home also 6 other mobiles are connected but I am getting a good speed to all the connections.
37234,3,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n
37235,5,Best router at this price range. It's very compact and lightweight. Though it's wi-fi range is not of some 4 antenna router still it's pretty good compared to other routers at this price range.
37236,4,Nice Product........ It's an amazing product which is having 4 antennas for giving a wider range of connectivity.And it is an absolute SMART ROUTER which has the option of getting the details of all the connected devices.You can also set the daily data quota which will save your data if you are having a limited data plan from your ISP.  You can additionally connect up to 64 devices at a time without losing any speed.  The range is not so good as I have expected.... It is not giving an adequat...
37237,5,Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.
37238,5,Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.
37239,2,The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.  Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough
37240,5,"most trusted band router with excellent product and work smoothly through MI WIFI app. thank flipkart and thank MI band ,nice looking and performing product ,I recommend all router user in INDIA to use mi router .Thank You."
37241,5,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only. Its a good router u have app support as well. Very good interface u can easily check if any unwanted one is using ur router. Good to have .....go for it .... Vfm (value for money) for sure ..!!
37242,5,Wonderful purchase!!! üòÉüòÉ The best product at this price... There is no router at this price this good... Lookswise also very sleek and elegant ‚ù§‚ù§ very happy! Must buy!!! üíï
37243,5,"Using it as a range extender (wired) , woking like a charm for me, Myth about ping ,it depends on your location like if you live in metro cities your ping will be very low (because metero cities have Larger number of servers) but if you live in small cities or town (like me) no matter which connection you buy your ping will never match with metero cities( because firstly our city server send their data to these metro cities server) trust me I've have tried many FTTH connection and never get..."
37244,3,Range is not good else ok..its good only for 1 bhk but you have to place in center then u will get proper connectivity
37245,5,"I am writing this review after one month of uses of the another great product from xiomi... First of all the interface of the app to access the router is very simple.. keep is mind if you need more than 2 lan port this product is surely not for you, otherwise blindly go for it... If you have big house like me then it is the best router you can get to cover all the rooms.."
37246,4,Great router. Just don't think that because of the 4 sticks it is gonna have exceptional range. Good product for its price.
37247,5,Love the product....not so good built quality ..but works very well and that too at very reasonable price
37248,5,Product was excellent the speed for. Playing youtube is awesome n we can connect upto 64 devices new device notification is also available n bandwidth speed is also set by ours
37249,5,"Using this as a Wireless Repeater. Working perfectly. No issues. Very few Setup steps, which is extremely helpful."
37250,5,"Edit: Problem solved after replacing the ISP modem provided by local ISP.  Old review:Have lots of features but there is no stability in the connection, but actual broadband connection is stable! Also wifi connects and disconnects frequently."
37251,5,nice
37252,5,Best
37253,5,Router is very good...and the delivery man is very fast nd niceüòä
37254,3,Everything is fine but many time in a day data automatically disconnected.. don't know why... I m getting frustrated.. with this product
37255,1,Very bad
37256,1,Worst router
37257,1,Very low range don't buy
37258,5,Great
37259,1,I purchased this router to extend JIOFI range but JIOFY itself provides far better coverage than this router. There is no refund option so I think I wasted my hard earned money :(
37260,5,Excellent Router from Mi in this price point. I asked few broadband technician about the product they said perfect router for home to office work.
37261,4,Good
37262,5,Supperb

37264,1,"Pls don't buy MI ROUTER. it's a very bad router. Maximum 10 miter are covered. It's very worst router. I thik TP link is much better. So, don't buy. After all it's have no refund policy. Only replacement policy."
37265,5,Best route in this Prince
37266,1,Worest router it's range is upto a single bedroom my Digisol single antena router is better than this one.Dont waste your money i returned it and return policy also very tough very very low range i think it is waste to have 4 antena single antena router is best than this one..
37267,3,Good Router having rich user interface alongwith mobile application. But does not meet my expectations. Some drawbacks are:-- 1. Range is not good in coparision to Dlink DIR-615 2. Does not assign static IP to router in Reapeater Mode(Wired or wireless)
37268,5,Nice!Nice Boostin&High Speed
37269,4,"Range is poor, rest everything is fantastic! I keep almost 8-9 device connected and all work flawless.  Since the range is less, keep it somewhere where it can send signals throughout the flat.  Hardware needs improvement, Software is best that nobody else gives."
37270,1,Pathetic product.. totally waste of money
37271,1,"It's bad. It don't give range. My friend and me took it 2 router together. Both router are bad. We have a plan of 5mbps, but it give20 kbps speed. West of money"
37272,1,The range of this router is low 5 mtr
37273,1,speed is good but range is horrible. it has given 4 antennas but range is very poor

37276,1,"This Is The Worst Product ... My 7 Yrs Old Tp Link Router Works Better than this.. Router Gets disconnected From internet very often for about 30-40 sec and again start working , i never faced this issue with my tp link router.. despite having 4 antenna range covarage is very poor my old Router was better .. guys just buy any dlink or tp-link Router .."
37277,5,Good
37278,5,Good quality good system go fo it
37279,4,Nice product I like it very much nice speed But it doesnt give speed with ethernet  That's the big prodlem
37280,3,"I am using this as a repeater.. pros: 1. smart looks 2.easy configuration 3. wifi range is good but had more expectation as it has 4 antennas. Cons: 1.sometimes too much packet loss 20% to 50%.Then it become very irritating while online gaming. 2.features are limited in repeater mode. 3.speed decreases up to 30% 4.It has a heating issue,but acceptable. 5.hardware is not the best  With a little more money you can get a better router of dilnk or tplink..."

37334,1,Worst Router I have ever used in my entire life
37335,3,"Thankyou Flipkart a quick delivery, the device arrived without any damages.  I am writing this review after 1 week of using the product.  Pros The device looks sleep and can be kept in any room without spoiling the look of the room. Easy to set up and connect The interface is awesome and can be easily used.  Cons Even with 4 antennas the range is bad."
37336,5,Awesome product ...Worth per penny..Love it.. Really loved it

37350,4,Nice product
37351,5,Best router in this budget segment.... Really awesome product. I love it so much
37352,2,Used this for almost a month. If you are spending 1K to get this. Would recommend to get a DLink for 1.5k. Because this MI router will give you high ping. Low wifi coverage. The connection will break if you are in a different room. In case you have a old build property then the scenerio would get even worse.
37353,5,Very good product no issue of coverage i don't know why everyone is complaining about the range i live on 3rd floor and the network reaches the ground floor too . Very satisfied
37354,5,Good on this price range.
37355,5,Router is exceptional.. Every one complaining about range but it is working gem for me as it is covering entire my house with full signal and even down floor with 3points.... Thank you flipkart for speedy delivery and delivering me orginal product
37356,5,Good product fot that price i liked it buy it guys.
37357,3,Ok ok product.. Range is not what i expected.. 4 antennas are just for the showcase nothing else.

37440,2,Poor quality. I will not suggest to purchase it
37441,3,The repeater mode is so bad. It keeps on disconnecting from the main router and the speed reduces significantly.

37587,3,Very easy to use router. The only negative point being sometimes the wifi network drops abruptly. I use it as bridge router and is working just fine. There was no packaging at all. I was delivered the box as it is as shared in pictures. The cover I think was not of the size so they didn't bothered to cover it up at all or provide any type of protection.
37588,4,Overall good

37596,1,Range is not good
37597,2,Range is very poor can't even cover a single story building. and is slower than the other counterparts. I would suggest to buy TP link.
37598,4,Beat
37599,5,The monitoring features is very good in MI router.
37600,5,Mi router 4C is the best wifi extender I have ever used. The best part is you can control all its features via Mi wifi app which is very easy to use. The network coverage is also very very good and this very easy to install and configure. I just want to mention one thing that I was little disappointed by the packaging flipkart provided. The router was not even wrapped in paper. The original packaging was also damaged because it was not wrapped.
37601,1,Too tough to connect with the app. Each and every time it shows error. :-(
37602,5,Ok thank you safe deliveryüëå

37620,1,"First time when connected, the RJ45 connector not inserted in the WAN port of the router, due to which no internet, After cutting and pressing the connector then with great difficulty it went in side the WAN port. Very poor router built quality Nothing great about the speed, I have 200Mbps plan and I get only 40Mbps from router"
37621,2,Very basic 2.4 Ghz Wifi Router . Easy to set up and use but Drops Internet once in a while and then gets connected by itself . OK for the price but better if you upgrade to a more stable dual band router
37622,4,"Nice bt some problem I face to configure,,,bt nice"
37623,5,Over all good.... But i mention that the of this router is not as expected... The four antennas are just show off i think.... Considering this the router is good... You can buy it... Over all decent product... Does the job
37624,4,Super
37625,5,Excellent
37626,5,Best Router i like it üòçüòç

37628,1,Bad
37629,5,"Good product. Don't have any complaints. Easy to configure Flipkart delivered very quickly, thanks for it..."
37630,3,Good for 1BHK apartment. Would not recommend for anything larger than that. Don't fall for those 4 antennas! App is user friendly. It provides features like bandwidth control for individual devices which comes in handy if you have a limited plan. If not for the area coverage its good in this budget.
37631,2,After 1 year problem occurs I was using this as a repeater my other wifi tht I am using since 4 year speed is awesome however as a repeater net speed is very bad.... In the beginning it was awesome...
37632,5,"Super product. I ordered pn 26th June 2021 and got delivered on 27th June 2021.  Good product, covers all over the house, can be used as a router or as a wifi extender."

37648,5,Good product
37649,5,I purchased this Mi router from flipkart after one of my cousin recommended me this. After installing this in my living room the wifi coverage problem is totally solved and the best part is that you can control all its features via Mi wifi app. Xiaomi as always is providing best value for money products in every category. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the product on time.

38150,1,Worst Item Dont Purchase Signal Strength Weak UI Management so difficult Many Reasons found to say

38153,4,Good
38154,2,Worst range
38155,2,Poor range.
38156,3,It's range is not good.
38157,4,Easy to configure and good coverage for a small house.  Compare to other devices it gave me hassle free configuration and moreover it's easy to install. Also the wire connector is big enough to keep distance.  However if you are looking for high speed more then 100mbps and bigger house then this would not fullfil your requirements.
38158,1,Wi-Fi low range
38159,4,NB :. It is a router not a modem.. It is only used to extend the connection and increase the coverage and speed  Don't underestimate it is the only thing needed for a broadband connection . A modem is also needed.
38160,2,The range is not working at all. Even doesn't reach ground floor from first floor.
38161,1,Don't purchase. Wifi range is too bad. After 6 month . Wifi Problems start . Download speed 400kbps on wifi. I have 100mbps plan on Airtel fiber .
38162,3,I'm using it as a wifi extender.. It serves the purpose

38224,5,Very Good Products and Weight is very Low..
38225,1,Reng very bad
38226,3,Very nice product but the frequency of the router is decreasing day by day
38227,1,network not proper
38228,3,im not recommded this router for more than 1000sqft area.signal strength is average.you can increase signal strenth by applying silver foil.miwifi app is really excellent. it can fully access to all devices connected to your wifi you can also set speed limit for specific devices.

38244,5,Good product
38245,1,Raise your money üí∞ so bad
38246,5,Nice product
38247,2,Very bad range. Four antenna attracts to purchase at that price. But performance is not even equal to some other two antenna router's. I regret this purchase üòè
38248,1,Ping is very worst
38249,1,Very very bad . don't by this router
38250,4,The Product Received on time and it was very good It was the value for money...!!
38251,2,Poor range Speed is also average. Go for some other options like tenda or D-Link
38252,4,Very good product. Working so fast.
38253,5,Good in signal üì∂strength
38254,5,Nice üëç product
38255,1,That product is very bad connectivity is very poor I am not recommended to buy . product only 10 days is not working .my rating is zero
38256,1,Faltu product
38257,3,Looks wise it's quite good. But the main reason for which anyone would buy this i.e. using the wifi the experience is not so good. Despite of having four antennas I'm not sure why it's range is not so good. It should be okay for two rooms. But beyond that one should not consider this.
38258,5,Very good product
38259,5,BEST IN CLASS.....................!
38260,5,It's very Nice and very Good Connectivity
38261,4,"average coverage,network speed distribution is awesome.....Thats all.."
38262,1,Range problem
38263,1,Poor signal quality
38264,4,I can give 4 star coz rage very good compared to D-Link. If u all have 2 BHK then this is very good for coverage even in washroom... Build is ok ok.. And very slim looks suprb Con:- Wire is too short... Two lane port
38265,1,Wrost router I have ever used. 50 Mbps connection but speed from router doesn't go beyond 10 Mbps. I suggest you all to do not buy this. It will waste your money. Even the response of company is also very very bad.
38266,1,Range gets dropping down in every month I'm using 100mps speed this router is not proving the range on this Totally un satisfied with the product...
38267,2,Range of 4 antena is too low as 1antenaüôÑ
38268,5,I can believe on mi after closing eyes.really it is nice product..
38269,5,Good
38270,3,Range is not up to the mark As accepted
38271,5,Very good
38272,5,Nice product
38273,3,Range is not as expected Only 15 meters range *in home I think this 4 antenna is not performing only one is active
38274,3,"I expect more range... But it provides almost every same range like tp-link, D-Link as this price range, otherwise it's a Good option.."
38275,5,Nice
38276,1,Wi-Fi Connecting problem auto Disconnecting and connect again after 2 min. I'm return this product.

38282,5,Good
38283,3,Good product
38284,5,The best router in this price range. This is my second purchase and this time it is being used as a repeater. The setup is very simple and intuitive. Only thing I hope is addition of 5Ghz in the next upgrade at this price point.
38285,1,It's is very bad product not working properly
38286,5,Excellent

38290,3,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è c
38291,5,It's a nice product.
38292,5,I've been using it for 1 month. Best product in market. *value for price *good range *more than enough speed(after using it as a secondary router too) *the web portal is very much user friendly. *one tap convert... (as a router or repeater(wireless and wired) through the mobile app).  ** the mobile app actually does nothing but starts the connectivity.  After all.. You can buy the product if you get it under 1k.
38293,2,Network coverage is too bad.
38294,1,Terrible purchase Used 1day but wifi range is horrible even speed is too not good. 4 antenas not working and covering i think
38295,4,Bohut acha hai nice warking ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
38296,5,The Best
38297,1,It didn't work only when tried before installation ....
38298,1,"Worst product. Mi router 3C was much better than this. Range of this router is not good when compared to the Mi 3C router. Mi 3C router has the advantage of running on powerbank but not 4C. If you are looking for good range, this one is not for you. Go for Tenda N301 or TP-Link 841N if your budget is around thousand rupees."
38299,5,Very easy to configure. Nice speed. Nice looking device from MI. Thanks Flipkart for awesome delivery experience
38300,1,Very poor poor range even my house is small but range doesn't cross even 10ft üò°üò°i used only 1 day
38301,1,Previously i was using mi router 3c it has good coverage This 4c model doesn't give even half of the strength of old router Really disappointing worse than mobile hotspot
38302,4,I like it but only two lan port
38303,3,An average router. Don't buy it if you are looking for high range.

38326,5,Pole item super net
38327,5,I love this product.. product price is very good as compared to other router.. but one demerit i have notice that tha range of MI router is too short.. overall product is very good .. but range of a router is not suitable for long distance around 450sq.ft.
38328,1,It is a damaged product
38329,5,The shipment was nice
38330,4,"4 antenna is just overkill, it isn't any better than tp link or D-Link 2 antenna models. The best part of this router is its software. Very useful and use to use."
38331,5,Super router very easy setup n good speed
38332,5,Mesmerizing.
38333,5,good product
38334,5,All good but range is low
38335,4,"Good product, I am using it as repeater for enhancing the existing wifi signals into the non covered area of my house. Good product. Very simple to setup through its mi wifi app."
38336,4,I thought my girlfriend is the best thing but this wifi proved me wrong
38337,2,Coverage is very bad... those 4 anntenas of no useüëéüèº
38338,5,Value for money
38339,3,Too good. But its china product.
38340,2,The range of the WiFi is not at all good. If you want to use it in 2 small rooms nearby then only it's good. Else go for something else.
38341,2,Don't buy this speed and range not good.Buy more trusted brands like Tplink and D-Link.My D-Link router covers almost half of home but this router can't even a single room.
38342,5,Good Product

38366,5,Awesome product it's working absolutely fine
38367,5,Nice flipkart
38368,4,"Light weight. No hook holes to hang. Four antennas are good. Minimal design. One main Lan port, two child Lan ports."
38369,1,Worst product ever
38370,5,Delivery man was too awesome üëçüëèüëèüëè thanks flipkart
38371,2,Not good range sometimes disconnect network
38372,3,"Good at this price range, single band(2.4 gHz).The router has 4 antenna, but they are for showing, range is good for small room. I even can't get signal at ground floor, my router is placed at 1st floor. Good for this price point."
38373,1,I bought this router last week firstly I felt that some technical issues should happened but after 1week also same problem happened with me again and again don‚Äôt buy this it won‚Äôt cover a single floor also very bad coverage.
38374,1,Very poor signal range.
38375,1,Very bad router .
38376,5,Best quality nice to work
38377,5,Best product
38378,4,"Hanged at a place were it can reach my complete home, product is very light and powerful and easy to install. We can control it by using Mi WiFi app"
38379,5,Good Product
38380,4,Thanks filpkart
38381,1,Very poor range. Highly disappointed with the performance. I was using tenda and d-link routers(both having single antenna) before opting for this router. I was expecting a big boost on the range but after using it i am shocked to see the poor reception. I‚Äôll strictly not recommend this router to anyone mainly cos of its poor range
38382,3,Very low coverage. Better to go for TP link
38383,5,Ruff tum all jaan
38384,5,"Best router ,,, amazing experience with mi . It covers my all rooms and speed is superb and through mi wifi app its super duper cool and easy to connect ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüëç"
38385,3,Overall an average Router! Good point: Very light weight Very nice design Easy to setup and manage through mobile app. Can be used as repeater.  Cons: Range is average even though it has 4 antennas. Less than my current router with 2 antennas. Have only 2 lan ports. Dont have a hole for hanging on wall. So you have to keep it on some surface.  More ports and a modem port for telephone line would have been added advantage but modem does not have it.  Overall a good average router. I use it as...
38386,5,This is very good quality product and my work is very well
38387,5,Excellent stability Excellent strength Low range coverage
38388,3,Good
38389,4,After usage of 4months. Its really nice product.
38390,3,"Good in terms of speed and fast connectivity, however the range is soo poor that am unable to connect it beyond 15 meters on any side even after making sure there are no signal interferences"
38391,5,Awesome
38392,4,Wi-Fi range is not satisfactory..
38393,5,Nice product. I have installed on ground floor and access internet on first floor as well.
38394,5,"Doesn't give much range, but good enough within a small range"
38395,4,It's good for home daily use.Easy to setup with a little tutorial.But if you have plans to connect your house having too many walls and obstructions it can be a little let down at the furthest point.Still the connectivity received is appreciable.Given the price point in which you get its more than your expectations.The app led monitoring feature is a real delight.
38396,1,The connectivity is not even there from 10metres of router whenever there is a power off the router doesn't connect with the internet it is not working properly can't even switch off the router
38397,5,Very Good Quality
38398,5,Very nice router. Worth buying it.
38399,4,"Heavy duty router , best of all 1 k range , performance peaks and lets see for how many months it will last"
38400,4,"Timely delivery. The product works good so far but it would be too early to say anything. I have a problem with the seller, as the product was sent without external packing. When I received parcel, the original box was wet and Mishandled."
38401,5,A smart product
38402,5,It is average
38403,1,Disgusting every time Wi-Fi was disconnecting and also Wi-Fi range was not good if range is below 3 nothing can work
38404,5,good item value for money
38405,3,Range is very limited go for other options.
38406,3,"Good, Range is not enough though"
38407,3,Distance is not as expected as it was..
38408,4,Good router but signal strength is not great.
38409,5,This wifi is very good
38410,4,Super iam Happy
38411,2,Worst product
38412,5,Too good a product. Totally worth the money.
38413,4,Good but rang is too Short......

38416,1,Bakwas wifi network
38417,5,Great
38418,3,I am not satisfied But wifi range is good
38419,4,"Delivered at time. However, packing is below the mark."
38420,1,No wall penetration. Ridiculous range.
38421,5,I have been using for 3months so far no speed drop or anything to worry. Best Router in this price range.
38422,1,wifi range and strength is worst
38423,5,Easy to connect.

38429,5,Good device
38430,1,Worest router

38746,4,Router is good. WAN port support 10/100 only not a giga port. We can convert this Tenda N301 to AP mode and its work as a WiFi extender.
38747,4,"Tenda n301 is a nice small and efficient device.. very lightweight. I bought it to use it as a repeater and it did the job well. I did run into a lot of issues in the setup, but some videos on YouTube did sort it out."
38748,5,"I bought for wifi repeater purpose , easy to configure. No issues faced, Good quality."
38749,5,"Budget Friendly, even though made in China. Currently we dont have other options. Quality looks fine and speed is really good. Would recommend this instead of spending extra on other expensive ones."

Range drops considerably when router is behind 1 or 2 walls and also affects the speed. But overall, it's a decent product for a 50mbps internet connection with 3-4 users if you position the router at the centre of your home. Easy to configure and budget friendly wireless router."

39217,3,"if you search for Dual Band then don't go for this product, must be there is a mistake while advertising by the advertiser. It has no function in its' wireless settings. I had used another dual band wifi router, that had the setting option for changing bands either. This product is only having dual antenna but not the dual band selection option. Overall performance is good, coverage area is maximum 60ft. It kills 10/15Mbps of total data capping. enjoy the product!"

If you use different SSID name, then frequently ur internet is going to disconnect from the main modem. So you have to keep same name and same password for the router.  2. If I use both router at a time, then the internet speed is dropped to 60 - 70 % from the main router.  Overall it is a good product."

39495,4,"Easy to install,good range ,getting speed upto 10mbps according to my net plan."
39496,4,As of now router is working fine but some time there is connectivity issue i guess it was due to local provider end.
39497,3,Easy to use
39498,2,There is a significant drop in the signal strength. A 30mbps connection gives only 5-8mbps throught this router but over 30mbps over Lan cable. The signal strength also drops after 5-8ft making it useless even for a 2bhk.

39539,1,Very poor product
39540,4,Good product
39541,4,Good wifi range
39542,4,It's Made In China. Otherwise it is great router with minimalist interface and range is good according to 2 antennas it will be worth it. You will face no loss till 5m after that it deteriorates and last you can get range upto 15-20 m radius that will be enough. Using it in the centre point of your house and you are good to go. Well I used it as a repeater it is extending main wifi's signal fully.  2.4GHz is the only mode for repeater too. Those who don't know Don't think that you will repeat...
39543,3,Ok working but signal not proper
39544,5,Super. Excellent wifi distribution. Very easy installation.
39545,5,Good one
39546,4,"After using almost 5 month I can say it one of the best router available .. It can penetrate 3 wall which is 5 inch , 10 inch , and 5 inch of thickness respectively with 40% signal strength .. and free space range is almost 50meter with 50% signal strength. If you place the router center of your house it can cover easily a 3bhk flat easily and can provide signal in 2 floor without any fluctuations.. In short just buy it..."

I've kept it as a repeater barely 15 feet from the router (also a Tenda router that came with the 16 mbps connection, in line of sight), and I've not managed to sqeeze out more than 3-4 mbps. Also, it randomly is unable to connect and has to be reconfigured again every second day. Better to go for Netgear."
